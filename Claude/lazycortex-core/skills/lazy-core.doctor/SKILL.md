# Project Health Check

Coordinator skill. Dispatches three **Explore** subagents in parallel to scan the project, merges their reports, presents a unified report, then applies user-confirmed fixes.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/lazy-core.parallel-scan.md` before dispatching for the coordinator pattern. Severity vocabulary: `PASS` / `WARN` / `FAIL`, plus `INFO` (reserved for Phase 2.5 transient status lines — e.g. "marketplace unreachable, used cached manifest" — that don't require a user fix).

**CRITICAL PATH RULE** (applies to every dispatched agent): `~/.claude/` is protected from Bash access. Agents must use ONLY Glob and Read under `~/.claude/`. Only project-root paths may use `wc -c`. For `~/.claude/` file sizes, estimate as `lines × 45 bytes`.

**Read-first**: collect all findings before any fix. Never fix silently.

## Phase 0 — Mode detection

Detect mode at the start of the run; pass the result to every dispatched agent and to Phase 2.6.

- **Local tool mode** — this repo *authors* plugins. Detected by `Glob("Claude/**/.claude-plugin/plugin.json")` returning any match. Every content check also applies to plugin sources under `Claude/**` (see per-agent scope expansions below). Outdated-plugin suppression (Phase 2.6) is **disabled** — the sources are authored here, so full integrity is required regardless of installed-plugin currency.
- **Release mode** (default) — this repo *consumes* installed plugins. Plugin-owned rule files in `.claude/rules/` and `~/.claude/rules/` are synced copies; if the owning plugin is outdated (per Phase 2.5), content-level findings on those files are suppressed by Phase 2.6 and only the version-outdated WARN is surfaced (upgrading will overwrite the stale content).

The per-plugin "owned namespaces" set computed by Agent A's Plugin rule sync check is the key used to decide plugin ownership of any given rule filename.

## Phase 1 — Dispatch parallel scans

Dispatch these three Explore agents **in a single message with three Agent tool calls** (`subagent_type: "Explore"`, `mode: "dontAsk"`). Each prompt ends with the structured report contract from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/lazy-core.parallel-scan.md` and a "Report under 400 words" budget.

### Agent A — artifact integrity

Scope: rules / agents / skills / commands files, their frontmatter, namespace format, hook scripts, gitignore coverage, cross-references, and `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (read-only).

**Local tool mode scope expansion**: when the coordinator reports local tool mode, also apply every rules / agents / skills / commands / hooks check below to the plugin sources at:

- `Claude/**/rules/*.md`
- `Claude/**/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `Claude/**/agents/*.md`
- `Claude/**/commands/*.md`
- `Claude/**/hooks/**`

Findings from plugin sources must carry a `source: plugin` marker so Phase 2.6 can distinguish them from release-mode sync'd copies.

**Plugin-ownership tagging (both modes)**: when emitting any finding on a file under `.claude/rules/` or `~/.claude/rules/`, record `plugin_owner: <name>` if the filename's leading dot-segment matches an installed plugin's owned namespace (see Plugin rule sync check). Leave the field absent for user-authored rules. Phase 2.6 uses this to suppress release-mode findings on outdated plugins.

Checks the agent performs:

- **Rules files** (`.claude/rules/*.md`, `~/.claude/rules/*.md`):
  - `[FAIL]` rules file > 3 KB
  - `[WARN]` contains a **broken artifact reference** — any of the below that doesn't exist at its expected location:
    - slash-command `/name` → no matching skill/command found
    - `Agent(subagent_type: "plugin:name")` or `subagent_type: "X"` → no matching agent/skill
    - `<namespace>.<name>.md` literal filename mentioned → file not present in rules dir
    - `references/...` or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/...` path → file missing
    - `hooks/...` script path → file missing
    - `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` path → file missing
    Markdown section headings (`## Phase 2.5`) are NOT checked — internal document structure.
  - `[FAIL]` contains code blocks > 10 lines
  - `[WARN]` no YAML frontmatter (need at minimum `description`, plus scope or waiver — see next bullet)
  - `[WARN]` frontmatter has **neither `paths:` scope nor `always_loaded:` waiver** — every unscoped rule burns tokens on every turn for every user. A rule must either declare a folder scope (`paths: ["glob", ...]` — only loaded when matching files are touched) or carry a short `always_loaded: <one-line reason>` waiver justifying why it must be in context every turn (e.g. governs every skill, constrains the main agent, encodes a safety posture applied to every action). The value IS the waiver — empty / boolean `true` is not accepted. Finding: `rule lacks scope and waiver | <path>`; `detail: frontmatter has neither paths nor always_loaded`; `fix: add paths: ["<glob>"] if scoped, or always_loaded: <reason> if truly global`. Coordinator-owned fix.
  - `[FAIL]` filename lacks dot separator (must be `namespace.name.md`)
- **Agents** (`.claude/agents/*.md`):
  - `[FAIL]` missing / malformed frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`)
  - `[WARN]` references a missing rules file
  - `[FAIL]` agent definition > 20 KB
- **Skills + commands** (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`, `~/.claude/commands/*.md`):
  - `[FAIL]` SKILL.md missing frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
  - `[WARN]` skill name in frontmatter doesn't match directory name
  - `[WARN]` skill references tools / agents that don't exist
  - `[WARN]` command file empty or < 50 bytes
- **Namespace** (skills / commands / agents / hooks / rules, skip `@`-prefixed external plugins):
  - `[FAIL]` name lacks dot separator
- **Hook-language gitignore coverage**: if project has `*.py`, `.gitignore` must cover `__pycache__/` and `*.py[cod]`; `*.rb` → `*.rbc`; `*.js`/`*.ts`/`package.json` → `node_modules/`. `[WARN]` when missing, only for languages actually used.
- **Cross-reference integrity**:
  - `[WARN]` agent referenced in CLAUDE.md but file missing
  - `[WARN]` command listed in CLAUDE.md but file missing
- **Plugin dependencies** (read `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`):
  - Build the installed-plugin set by stripping the `@<marketplace>` suffix from each top-level key, keeping only entries whose scope applies to this project (same filter the Phase 3 availability probes use: `scope: "user"`, or `scope: "project"` with `projectPath` matching the current repo).
  - For each installed plugin, read `<installPath>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and collect its `dependencies` array (default empty if absent).
  - `[WARN]` for each `<dep>` in that array where `<dep>` is not present in the installed-plugin set. Finding: `plugin <name> requires <dep> but <dep> is not installed — install it via its marketplace entry or remove the dependency`.
- **Plugin rule sync** (same installed-plugin set as above) — for each installed plugin that ships a `rules/` directory:
  - Glob `<installPath>/rules/*.md` → source-rule set; empty set → skip this plugin.
  - Compute the plugin's owned namespaces: the set of leading dot-segments from source-rule filenames (e.g. `lazy-log.logging.md` → `lazy-log`). One plugin may own multiple namespaces (e.g. `lazycortex-core` ships `lazy-core.*` and `lazy-guard.*`).
  - **Drift**: for each source rule whose filename also exists at `.claude/rules/<filename>` (or `~/.claude/rules/<filename>` for user-scoped installs), compare contents. If bytes differ → `[WARN] rule <filename> drifted from <plugin> source — run /<namespace>.install to reconcile (per-rule overwrite/keep-local/merge prompt)`.
  - **Orphan**: any file in target rules dir whose filename matches one of the plugin's owned namespaces but is NOT in the source-rule set → `[WARN] rule <filename> is an orphan from <plugin> (removed between versions) — run /<namespace>.install to offer deletion`.
  - Missing rules (in source but not in target) are NOT a finding — users deliberately skip rules at install time via the per-rule `AskUserQuestion` prompt.

Agent must not propose fixes beyond one-line hints — coordinator owns fixes.

### Agent B — config + memory

Scope: settings files, memory index, CLAUDE.md files, hook registration, MCP server enablement.

Checks the agent performs:

- **Settings consistency** — read all four:
  ```
  ~/.claude/settings.json          ~/.claude/settings.local.json
  .claude/settings.json            .claude/settings.local.json
  ```
  - `[FAIL]` any file is not valid JSON
  - `[FAIL]` project-specific permissions (service CLIs, `additionalDirectories`, service MCP servers, domain-specific WebFetch) in global `settings.json` instead of project `settings.local.json`
  - `[WARN]` duplicate permission entries across global + project files
  - `[WARN]` project `settings.json` (tracked) contains machine-specific paths
- **Permissions leakage into tracked `settings.json`** (both `~/.claude/settings.json` and `./.claude/settings.json`):
  - Per-tool permission entries are personal and should live in the paired `settings.local.json` (gitignored), not in tracked `settings.json` where they ship to every teammate who clones the repo / dotfiles.
  - `[WARN]` tracked file has a `permissions.allow` or `permissions.ask` array containing any entry. Finding: `tracked settings file owns per-tool permissions — these leak to teammates | <path>`; `detail:` count of entries in each list; `fix: migrate permissions.* block to <paired settings.local.json>` (coordinator-owned fix — see Phase 4).
  - Tracked `settings.json` may still own `enabledPlugins`, `enabledMcpjsonServers`, `enableAllProjectMcpServers`, `hooks`, `env` (non-secret), and similar enablement flags that teammates legitimately share. Only `permissions.*` is flagged.
- **Memory consistency** — locate project memory dir under `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` matching the current project path:
  - `[FAIL]` `MEMORY.md` references a missing file
  - `[WARN]` memory `.md` exists but is not indexed in `MEMORY.md`
  - `[WARN]` `MEMORY.md` > 5 KB
  - `[WARN]` any memory file missing frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`)
  - `[WARN]` memory `type` not one of: `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`
- **CLAUDE.md files**:
  - `[WARN]` project `CLAUDE.md` references paths that don't exist
  - `[WARN]` project `CLAUDE.md` > 10 KB
  - `[WARN]` global `CLAUDE.md` contains project-specific instructions
- **Always-loaded context budget** — sum the byte size of everything Claude Code auto-loads into every session's context on every turn:
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - `<project>/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - Every `~/.claude/rules/*.md` **without** a `paths:` key in YAML frontmatter (scoped rules only load when files under their glob are touched, so they don't count toward the always-loaded budget)
  - Every `<project>/.claude/rules/*.md` **without** a `paths:` key in YAML frontmatter
  Thresholds: `[WARN]` total > 20 KB, `[FAIL]` total > 40 KB. This is the real token budget — individual per-file limits are a crude proxy; the sum is what hits every turn. Finding must list per-file breakdown (largest first) so the user knows what to cut.
- **Hooks** (registered in global `settings.json` under `hooks.*`):
  - `[FAIL]` hook command references a missing script
  - `[WARN]` hook script imports a module that is **not stdlib AND not declared in a project dependency manifest** (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `Cargo.toml` — match by interpreter). Declared third-party deps are fine; undeclared ones create install risk for teammates and slow every hook invocation.
  - `[WARN]` hook timeout > 10s
  - `[WARN]` hook scripts contain hardcoded project paths without sidecar configs
- **MCP server configuration** — check `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/settings.local.json`, project `.claude/settings.json`, `~/.mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`:
  - Determine mode first: Mode A (`enableAllProjectMcpServers: true`) or Mode B (explicit `enabledMcpjsonServers`).
  - `[FAIL]` any `.mcp.json` malformed
  - Mode A only: suppress "declared but not enabled" warnings.
  - Mode B only: `[WARN]` server in project `.mcp.json` but absent from any `enabledMcpjsonServers`; `[WARN]` non-empty project `.mcp.json` but no `enabledMcpjsonServers` anywhere
  - Always: `[WARN]` name in `enabledMcpjsonServers` but not defined in project `.mcp.json` or `~/.mcp.json`
- **MCP permission wildcard detection** — Claude Code matches `permissions.allow` / `permissions.ask` / `permissions.deny` entries as **exact strings**. Wildcards (`*`, `?`) and brace expansions (`{foo,bar}`) in MCP permission entries are silently no-ops: the entry never matches any real tool call, so the "allow" or "ask" never takes effect and every invocation falls through to the default per-call prompt. Scan every permissions file (all four settings files listed above) and flag:
  - `[WARN]` MCP permission entry contains a wildcard — `entry matches /^mcp__/ AND entry contains any of: *, ?, {`. Finding: `MCP permission entry will never match — wildcards/braces are not expanded | <path>`; `detail:` quote the offending entry (e.g. `mcp__github__*`) and the owning list (`allow` / `ask` / `deny`); `fix: enumerate the exact mcp__<server>__<tool> names via lazy-guard.allow-mcp <server>` — that skill reads the runtime tool list and writes concrete entries.
  - A leading `^mcp__` guard on the regex avoids flagging non-MCP entries like `Bash(git push *)` or `Read(~/.claude/**)` which legitimately use Claude Code's own glob matcher. Only `mcp__*` entries are affected by this restriction.
- **MCP permissions hygiene** — for every *enabled* MCP server, verify that destructive tools aren't sitting in `allow`. The doctor **does not** flag "missing" tools — `skip` is a valid classification and per-call prompting is the intended fallback. The doctor also **does not** flag medium-risk (`skip`-classified) tools that the user pinned into `allow` or `ask` — that's a deliberate user decision, not a hygiene issue. Completeness and bucket re-shuffling are `lazy-guard.allow-mcp`'s job when the user invokes it; here we only catch truly destructive entries sitting in `allow` where they bypass confirmation.
  - Enumerate runtime tools by listing every tool name visible in your own tool list whose name matches `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, grouped by `<server>`. Do NOT invent names — only use names literally present. Claude Code matches exact strings in both `allow` and `ask`; no wildcards.
  - A server counts as *enabled* iff it's defined in `~/.mcp.json` or `./.mcp.json` AND (Mode A, OR listed in `enabledMcpjsonServers` in either `./.claude/settings.json` or `./.claude/settings.local.json`). Skip servers that are defined-but-disabled, and skip servers that produced zero runtime tools (the server isn't loaded — a restart issue, not a permissions issue).
  - Resolve the target settings file per server using the routing rule from `lazy-guard.allow-mcp` Phase 4: default target is **`settings.local.json`** at the scope matching the server definition (global servers → `~/.claude/settings.local.json` if the user registered globally; else `./.claude/settings.local.json`). Doctor checks both the target and the paired tracked `settings.json` (for leakage).
  - Classify each runtime tool using the 3-bucket classifier from `lazy-guard.allow-mcp` Phase 3:
    - **`allow`** — read verbs (get/list/search/query/recall/reflect/resolve/diff/status/show/log-as-read/fetch/refresh/audit) AND low-risk writes the user already trusts (`git_add`, `git_create_branch`, `retain`, `sync_retain`, `create_directive`, `create_mental_model`, `update_bank`, `update_mental_model`).
    - **`ask`** — irreversible destruction: `delete_*`, `remove_*`, `clear_*`, `reset*`, `checkout*`, `restore*`, `revert*`, force-pushes, bulk destructive ops.
    - **`skip`** — medium-risk verbs that should *not* be in either list: `commit*`, `cancel_*`, and anything ambiguous. Skipped tools trigger Claude Code's per-call prompt.
  - Two comparisons per server (on the target `settings.local.json`):
    1. `misclassified_destructive = { t ∈ permissions.allow : t matches mcp__<server>__* AND classifier(t) == "ask" }` → `[WARN] Destructive MCP tools in allow list: <server> (<N> entries) | <target>`; `detail:` list the mis-placed tool names (`should be in permissions.ask — they cause irreversible loss and must prompt each time`); `fix: run lazy-guard.allow-mcp <server>` — allow-mcp will move them.
    2. `leaked_into_tracked = { t ∈ (tracked.permissions.allow ∪ tracked.permissions.ask) : t matches mcp__<server>__* }` → covered by the "Permissions leakage into tracked `settings.json`" check above; cross-reference but don't double-emit.
  - Emit at most one finding per server (misclassified). Do NOT emit per-tool findings — grouped lines keep the report scannable. Medium-risk (`skip`-classified) tools pinned to `allow` or `ask` are a user decision and never a finding.

### Agent C — path hygiene

Scope: every project-level config file (`.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`, `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`), grepping for hardcoded paths.

**Local tool mode scope expansion**: when the coordinator reports local tool mode, also grep for the same hardcoded-path patterns across `Claude/**/rules/*.md`, `Claude/**/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `Claude/**/agents/*.md`, `Claude/**/commands/*.md`, and `Claude/**/hooks/**`. Self-referential documentation of the path-hygiene rule itself (files whose purpose is to describe the bad patterns — e.g. `lazy-core.hygiene.md`, `lazy-guard.security.md`, `lazy-core.doctor/SKILL.md`, `lazy-guard.check-public/SKILL.md`) must be excluded via the `source: doc-of-rule` marker to avoid false positives.

Checks the agent performs:

- `[FAIL]` file contains `/Users/` or `/home/` (hardcoded absolute user path)
- `[FAIL]` file contains `<project>/` prefix (use relative paths instead)
- `[WARN]` file contains `~/Dropbox/` or other user-specific home subdirectories
- `[WARN]` file references `~/.claude/` for something that is actually project-local

Allowed `~/.claude/` references (agent must exclude these from WARN):
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `~/.claude/settings.json` / `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
- `~/.claude/rules/*.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/*.md`
- `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`
- `~/.mcp.json`

## Phase 2 — Collect + merge

Parse each returned block by splitting on `## scan:` headings. Deduplicate findings when two agents report the same `<path>:<line>` + title (happens rarely; A vs B overlap is minimal). Sum the three `### summary` blocks into overall `PASS / WARN / FAIL` counts.

## Phase 2.5 — Plugin version currency

Coordinator-owned inline check (not an Explore agent — it performs a `git fetch`, which violates the parallel-scan read-only contract). Runs in the main session after the merge above and before delegated audits.

Steps:

1. **Collect installed plugins.** Read `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Keep only entries whose scope applies to this project: `scope: "user"`, OR `scope: "project"` with `projectPath` equal to the current repo path. Same filter Agent A already uses.
2. **Group by marketplace.** Strip the `@<marketplace>` suffix from each top-level key → `{ marketplace → [plugin entries] }`.
3. **Refresh each referenced marketplace (live).** Read `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` to resolve each marketplace's `source` and `installLocation`. For each:
   - If `source.source == "github"`: run `git -C <installLocation> fetch --quiet origin` with a **5-second timeout** (`timeout 5 git ...` on Linux, `gtimeout` or `perl -e 'alarm 5; exec @ARGV'` fallbacks on macOS). Then read the latest manifest via `git show origin/HEAD:.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Non-destructive — working tree untouched, only remote-tracking refs advance.
   - On fetch timeout, fetch failure, or parse failure: fall back to the on-disk `<installLocation>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and emit one `[INFO]` line (see schema).
   - Non-github sources (none today): read the cached manifest directly and treat as fallback.
4. **Parse remote manifests.** Extract `plugins[].name` and `plugins[].version` from each refreshed `marketplace.json`.
5. **Compare.** For each installed plugin, look up the marketplace entry by name and compare version strings with plain equality — no semver parsing. A genuine downgrade (marketplace moved backwards) is still surfaced; acceptable.
6. **Emit findings** into the merged list rendered by Phase 4.

Finding schema:

- Outdated plugin:
  `[WARN] plugin <name>@<mp> is outdated (<installed> → <latest>) | installed_plugins.json`
  `detail: scope=<user|project> | path=<installPath>`
  `fix: run `/plugin update <name>` or `/plugin install <name>@<mp>` to upgrade`
- Unrecorded installed version (installed_plugins.json has `version: "unknown"`):
  `[WARN] plugin <name>@<mp> has unrecorded version (installed_plugins.json shows "unknown") | installed_plugins.json`
  `detail: latest in marketplace: <latest>`
  `fix: reinstall via `/plugin install <name>@<mp>` so the version is recorded`
- Marketplace cache fallback (one per unreachable marketplace):
  `[INFO] marketplace <mp> unreachable — using cached manifest (last updated <lastUpdated>)`

Worst-case latency: 5 s × number of referenced marketplaces (sequential today; parallelize if it bites).

## Phase 2.6 — Release-mode outdated-plugin suppression

Runs after Phase 2.5, before delegated audits. **Skipped entirely in local tool mode** (Phase 0 disables it — plugin sources are authored here, so every check must surface).

Build the outdated set from Phase 2.5:

- `outdated_plugins = { p : Phase 2.5 emitted either the "outdated" WARN or the "unrecorded version" WARN for p }`

Filter the merged findings in place:

- For any finding whose `path` starts with `.claude/rules/` or `~/.claude/rules/` AND whose `plugin_owner` field (set by Agent A) is in `outdated_plugins`, **drop the finding from the merged list** and increment a `suppressed_by_outdated_plugin` counter keyed by plugin.
- Findings with no `plugin_owner` (user-authored rules) are never suppressed.
- Findings from Agent A Plugin rule sync (drift / orphan) are never suppressed — drift is exactly what an upgrade resolves, and the finding itself is the pointer.
- Findings from any other agent / scope (Agent B, Agent C, cross-reference integrity, etc.) are never suppressed.

For each plugin with a non-zero `suppressed_by_outdated_plugin` counter, emit one summary line alongside the existing version WARN:

`[INFO] <N> content findings on <plugin>-owned rules suppressed — upgrade via `/plugin update <name>` to re-validate.`

This keeps the user focused on the root cause (stale install) instead of chasing content issues that the upgrade will overwrite. Re-run the doctor after upgrading to surface any remaining issues.

## Phase 3 — Delegated audits (inline, not dispatched)

Doctor delegates to sibling audit skills for scope-specific checks rather than replicating their logic. Each sub-check verifies the sibling skill is reachable, then checks its run condition, and silently skips if either fails. Doctor never warns about missing sibling plugins.

Each delegation follows four steps:

1. **Availability probe** — is the sibling skill reachable?
2. **Run condition** — is the opt-in gate satisfied?
3. **On skip** — if either fails, skip silently; no entry in the report.
4. **On invoke** — fold the sibling's summary into a named subsection; direct the user to run the sibling for interactive fixes. Do NOT re-run its fix flow.

**11a. Public-repo guard** → `lazy-guard.check-public`
- *Availability*: `lazycortex-core` appears in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` for a scope applying to this project.
- *Run condition*: `.guard-waivers.json` exists at the repo root.
- *On invoke*: fold guard's summary (category × severity counts, waivered count) and FAIL/WARN findings into a **Guard** subsection.

**11b. Logging coverage** → `lazy-log.audit`
- *Availability*: `lazycortex-log` appears in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` for a scope applying to this project.
- *Run condition*: same as availability — plugin installation is the opt-in.
- *On invoke*: fold audit findings into a **Logging** subsection.

## Phase 4 — Present + fix

Render in the existing format:

```markdown
## lazy-core.doctor -- Health Report

### Summary
- Checks run: N
- PASS: N | WARN: N | FAIL: N

### Issues

#### [FAIL] Rules: openclaw.md is 25 KB (limit: 3 KB)
Reference material should be in .claude/agents/openclaw-config.md.
**Fix**: Run `/lazy-core.optimize` to slim rules files.

#### [WARN] Memory: feedback_old_thing.md not in MEMORY.md index
File exists but has no index entry.
**Fix**: Add `- [old-thing](feedback_old_thing.md) — <description>` to MEMORY.md

(... one section per issue, followed by Guard and Logging subsections if delegated audits ran ...)

### Fixes available
- [ ] Fix 1: <description> (auto-fixable)
- [ ] Fix 2: <description> (auto-fixable)
- [ ] Fix 3: <description> (needs manual review)

Apply all auto-fixable? [y/N]
```

After the report, ask the user which fixes to apply. Apply only confirmed fixes. Fixes available in-coordinator:

- Rules oversized → suggest running `/lazy-core.optimize`; don't auto-slim here.
- Rule drift / orphans → direct the user to run the owning plugin's install skill (`/<namespace>.install`, e.g. `/lazy-log.install` for `lazy-log.*` rules). Do NOT auto-overwrite here — the install skill's per-rule `AskUserQuestion` is the sanctioned reconciliation flow.
- Missing rules frontmatter → add `---\ndescription: ...\npaths: [...]\n---` for scoped rules, or `---\ndescription: ...\nalways_loaded: <one-line reason>\n---` for rules that must load every turn.
- Rule lacks scope AND waiver → ask the user, per rule, whether the rule is legitimately always-loaded. If yes, add `always_loaded: <reason>` (reason must be substantive — one line explaining *why* every turn needs it, not `true`). If no, add `paths: ["<glob>"]` narrowing it to the folders where it applies. Show the proposed frontmatter diff before writing. Never auto-pick a scope — only the user knows the rule's true audience.
- Memory index: add missing entries, remove broken links; flag stale for review.
- Settings leakage: offer to move entries between files (respect the split in `rules/lazy-core.hygiene.md`).
- Permissions leakage into tracked `settings.json`: offer an in-place migration — move the entire `permissions.*` block (both `allow` and `ask` arrays) from tracked `settings.json` to the paired `settings.local.json`. Merge with any existing entries there, preserving order and deduplicating. Leave `enabledPlugins`, `hooks`, `env`, `enabledMcpjsonServers`, and similar enablement flags in the tracked file untouched. Show the diff before writing; apply only on explicit user confirmation.
- Gitignore coverage: append missing patterns under a dedicated language section.
- Path hygiene: replace hardcoded paths with relative equivalents; show diff before applying.
- MCP enablement: either set `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` in global settings or add `enabledMcpjsonServers` to project settings; remove stale entries.
- MCP tools not whitelisted: invoke `lazy-guard.allow-mcp <server>` for each confirmed finding — do NOT write `permissions.allow` directly from doctor. `allow-mcp` owns scope-routing, dedup, and cross-scope cleanup; reusing it keeps both skills consistent.
- Agents / skills / CLAUDE.md / hook scripts — report only, never auto-edit.
- Plugin dependency warnings — report only; fixing requires enabling the missing plugin in `settings.json` (user's decision) or editing the declaring plugin's manifest.
- Plugin outdated / unrecorded version (Phase 2.5) — report only; direct the user to run `/plugin update <name>` or reinstall. Doctor never shells out to `claude plugin update`. In release mode, Phase 2.6 suppresses content findings on this plugin's owned rules — the suppression counter is surfaced so the user knows to re-run after upgrading.

For any finding surfaced by a delegated audit (Guard / Logging), direct the user to run that sibling skill for fixes. Doctor never auto-fixes issues owned by sibling audits.

## Logging

Log to `./.logs/claude/lazy-core.doctor/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`.
Use `Bash(mkdir -p ...)` then `Write` tool (never chain).
