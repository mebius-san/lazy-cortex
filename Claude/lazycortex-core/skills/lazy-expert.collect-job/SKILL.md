# Expert Collect Job

Poll a named expert's job for its result. Returns `{status, response}` where `status` is `pending`, `done`, or `failed`. When `done`, prints the `result` file paths from `response.json` so the caller can `Read` them.

## Execution discipline (MANDATORY — read before any action)

This skill has 4 ordered steps. The executing agent MUST NOT skip, merge, reorder, or silently omit any step. To make dropped steps structurally impossible:

1. **Before calling any other tool**, call `TaskCreate` with exactly one task per step below — no merging, no abbreviation, no renaming. The canonical list (use these titles verbatim):
   - `Step 1 — Validate inputs`
   - `Step 2 — Collect job`
   - `Step 3 — Report`
   - `Step 4 — Log the run`
2. **Mark each task `in_progress` on enter and `completed` on exit.** "Completed" means "I executed the step's logic AND produced an outcome word for it". No-ops count only if they emit an explicit outcome (`asserted`, `unchanged`, `skipped-per-user-choice`, …).
3. **Do not reach the Report step until `TaskList` shows every prior task `completed` or explicitly `skipped` with an outcome.** A still-`pending` task is a bug — stop and execute it first.
4. **The Report step is a structural verifier.** Its output MUST contain one line per task above. A missing line is a bug; do not render the report with gaps.

## Step 1 — Validate inputs

Required inputs from the caller:
- `expert_name` (string) — the expert key.
- `job_id` (string) — the job identifier returned by `/lazy-expert.dispatch-job`.

Both must be non-empty strings. If either is absent → abort with: "`<field>` is required."

Outcome: `validated` or `aborted`.

## Step 2 — Collect job

Shell out to `expert_runtime.collect_job`:

```
Bash(PYTHONPATH=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin python3 -c "
import json, sys
from pathlib import Path
from expert_runtime import collect_job
result = collect_job(Path('.'), sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
print(json.dumps(result))
" '<expert_name>' '<job_id>')
```

Capture and parse the JSON output: `{status, response?}`.

- `status == "pending"` — job is queued; DONE marker not yet written.
- `status == "done"` — DONE marker present and `response.outcome != "error"`.
- `status == "failed"` — DONE marker present and `response.outcome == "error"`.
- `status == "missing"` — job directory does not exist.

Outcome: `collected`.

## Step 3 — Report

One line per task in the canonical list, with its outcome word. A missing line is a bug.

Print status summary:

```
status: <status>
```

If `status == "done"` and `response.result[]` is non-empty, list the result file paths:

```
result files (Read these to retrieve output):
  - <path>
  - <path>
```

If `status == "failed"`, print `response.error` (or `response.message`) if present.

If `status == "missing"`, print: "Job `<job_id>` not found for expert `<expert_name>`. Check the job_id or expert_name."

## Step 4 — Log the run

```
Bash(mkdir -p .logs/claude/lazy-expert.collect-job)
```

Then `Write` to `.logs/claude/lazy-expert.collect-job/<UTC-timestamp>.md`:

```yaml
---
git_sha: <git rev-parse HEAD>
git_branch: <git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD>
date: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC>
input: "expert_name=<expert_name> job_id=<job_id>"
---
```

`# lazy-expert.collect-job`

`## Actions`
- Validated inputs
- Called collect_job

`## Result`
`<success|failure>` — status=`<status>`.

## Failure modes

- **"job_id is required"** — caller omitted the job_id argument → supply the job_id returned by `/lazy-expert.dispatch-job`.
- **status == "missing"** — the job directory was never created or was already cancelled → verify the job_id and expert_name are correct; re-dispatch if needed.
- **Malformed response.json** — `collect_job` reads `response.json` and may raise `json.JSONDecodeError` if the expert wrote invalid JSON → inspect the file at `.claude/experts/.jobs/<expert>/<job_id>/response.json` directly.
- **Python `ModuleNotFoundError`** — plugin not installed or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` not set → run `/lazy-core.install`.
