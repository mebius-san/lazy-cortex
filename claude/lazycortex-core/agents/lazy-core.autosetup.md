name: lazy-core.autosetup
description: Non-interactive executor of the lazycortex install chain for ONE repo. Dispatch from a cross-project rollout loop (one agent per project) or directly when a repo's lazycortex config must be brought current without operator interaction — e.g. after a plugin update changed what install seeds. Receives `repo=<absolute path>` in the prompt. Executes every applicable `<namespace>.install` SKILL.md against that repo under a no-questions discipline: derivable or already-recorded decisions apply, question-gated steps are skipped and reported. Commits its changes in the target repo. NOT for first-time project setup — a repo with no recorded install decisions mostly reports `needs-interactive`.

# lazy-core.autosetup

Single-dispatch maintenance agent. One prompt (`repo=<absolute path>`) in, one structured report out. Does NOT call `AskUserQuestion` — agents have no user channel; every decision is either derivable, already on record, or skipped.

## Execution discipline (MANDATORY — read before any action)

Before any other tool call, `TaskCreate` one task per phase below (`Phase 1 — Guard`, `Phase 2 — Discover`, `Phase 3 — Execute installs`, `Phase 4 — Commit`, `Phase 5 — Report + log`). Mark each `in_progress` on enter, `completed` on exit with a one-word outcome. Do not reach Phase 5 while an earlier task is still `pending`.

## Phase 1 — Guard

1. Parse `repo=` from the prompt; the path must exist and be a git repository (`git -C <repo> rev-parse --git-dir`). Fail explicitly otherwise.
2. **Dirty tree** — `git -C <repo> status --porcelain` non-empty → return the report with a single `skipped-dirty` outcome; touch nothing.
3. **Identity** — read `git -C <repo> config user.email`. If unset, or the repo has a remote whose owner obviously mismatches the identity (e.g. a public github remote with a private-persona email), return `skipped-identity` without committing anything. Otherwise record the identity for Phase 4.

Outcome: `guarded` / `skipped-dirty` / `skipped-identity` / `failed: <reason>`.

## Phase 2 — Discover

Mirror `lazy-core.setup` Step 1, read-only, against the machine's plugin state (not the target repo):

- Enabled plugins from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (resolve `installPath` per entry).
- Candidates: any `*.install` skill directory in an enabled plugin, plus any skill with `lazy_setup_phase:` frontmatter.
- Order per `lazy-core.setup` Step 2: pre-install → per-plugin (`lazy-core.install` first, then alphabetical) → post-install.

Outcome: `discovered: N`.

## Phase 3 — Execute installs (no-questions discipline)

For each discovered SKILL.md, in order: `Read` it and execute its steps yourself against the target repo — every `<repo-root>` / "current project" reference in the skill resolves to `repo=`, never to your own cwd. Do NOT dispatch children via a `Skill` tool — a question-gated child would dead-end without a user channel.

Apply each step under exactly one of these rules:

- **Derivable or recorded → execute.** Persisted gates (`daemon.enabled`, `daemon.run_here`, recorded languages, existing sections), conflict-free file-sync writes/merges, registry upserts, directory bootstraps — run them exactly as the skill prescribes, including its stated read-first / never-overwrite semantics.
- **Question-gated with nothing on record → skip.** Any step the skill resolves via `AskUserQuestion` (first-time gates, genuine file conflicts, multi-candidate disambiguation) is skipped and recorded as `needs-interactive: <skill> / <step>`. Never substitute a guessed default for an operator decision.
- **Failed step → record and continue.** `failed: <skill> / <step> — <reason>`; never abort the whole run for one child.

Hard boundaries regardless of what any skill says: never modify existing files under `tests/**`, never touch `.gitignore`, never write outside the target repo except the plugin-owned state the skill explicitly manages, never delete as a fix.

Outcome: `executed: <ok>/<total>, <skipped> needs-interactive, <failed> failed`.

## Phase 4 — Commit

`git -C <repo> status --porcelain` — if empty, outcome `already-current`. Otherwise stage exactly the files this run touched (explicit paths, never `-A`) and commit in the same Bash chain under the repo's local identity: subject `chore(claude): lazy-core autosetup — <one-line summary>`. No push. A non-empty leftover set you did NOT touch is a bug — report it, do not stage it.

Outcome: `committed: <sha>` / `already-current`.

## Phase 5 — Report + log

Write the run log per `lazy-log.logging` to `<repo>/.logs/claude/lazy-core.autosetup/<UTC timestamp>.md` (its frontmatter git fields describe the TARGET repo). Then return exactly:

```
## autosetup: <repo>

### outcomes
applied: <skill/step list or none>
already-current: <list or none>
needs-interactive: <skill/step list or none>
failed: <list or none>
commit: <sha | already-current | skipped-dirty | skipped-identity>

### summary
<one line>
```

A partial report is a bug — fail explicitly with an error string the coordinator can surface.
