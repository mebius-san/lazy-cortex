# Changelog

User-visible changes per plugin release. Each plugin in this marketplace is versioned independently via SemVer.

## lazycortex-core

### 5.10.0 — 2026-07-08 UTC

- New `lazycortex-core detect-scope <plugin@marketplace>` subcommand resolves a plugin's install target from where it is actually *enabled* — the project's `enabledPlugins` first, then the user's — falling back to the install record's own `scope` only when neither settings file enables it. Sibling plugin install skills use it so their generated config lands where the plugin is active, not wherever `/plugin install` last ran.

### 5.9.0 — 2026-07-06 UTC

- New `daemon.git.post_push_hook` config lets the runtime daemon run a shell command after every successful push, passing repo/branch/SHA details via env vars; hook failures are isolated and never block a tick.
- Default model-tier config now covers the new `fiction-writer` agent (lazycortex-experts), so tier resolution works out of the box once both plugins are installed.

### 5.8.3 — 2026-07-05 UTC

- New idle-stdout watchdog detects frozen expert-spawn (`claude -p`) runs and kills + retries them instead of hanging the job queue forever, with each stall recorded to the runtime log; retry limit and timeout are tunable via `daemon.stream_idle_timeout_sec` / `daemon.stream_max_retries` (sane defaults, no config required, and a negative retry count no longer breaks the retry loop).

### 5.8.2 — 2026-07-04 UTC

- Expert spawns now skip the ~40s per-Bash-call overhead from core hooks (git-guard, model-router, check-public, settings-guard, commit-recorder) by default — opt individual hooks back in per expert via `hooks.enabled`. Interactive sessions can also silence any hook for themselves with a root `hooks.disabled` block-list.

### 5.8.1 — 2026-07-04 UTC

- Removed the `--bare` minimal-mode option for expert spawns that shipped in 5.8.0; expert spawns now only use the hermetic `--setting-sources project,local` default (and its explicit per-expert opt-in). No change for the default spawn path.

### 5.8.0 — 2026-07-04 UTC

- Expert spawns are now hermetic on settings scope too: by default only project/local settings load (`--setting-sources project,local`), so a stuck user-scope plugin hook can no longer hang a headless expert job the way an interactive-auth MCP server used to. An expert opts back into user-scope settings per entry under `lazy.settings.json[experts]`; `/lazy-runtime.preflight` reports each expert's effective settings scopes.

### 5.7.0 — 2026-07-03 UTC

- Expert spawns now run fully isolated from ambient MCP servers (`--strict-mcp-config`), fixing headless expert jobs that hung on an interactive-auth MCP server's initialization until they timed out. An expert that genuinely needs specific MCP servers declares them via a new per-expert `mcp_config` field under `lazy.settings.json[experts]`; ambient operator servers (`~/.claude.json`, project `.mcp.json`) are no longer inherited.
- New `/lazy-runtime.preflight` skill validates that every routine-dispatched expert is actually launchable — static config checks plus a trivial-prompt launch probe that catches hanging or auth-blocked MCP servers before a job runs — and proposes operator-confirmed fixes.

### 5.6.0 — 2026-07-01 UTC

- Expert spawns now load their sandbox from a daemon-owned `.runtime/sandbox.settings.json` (passed via `--settings`) instead of the session-wide `settings.local.json`, so the interactive session in the same checkout is no longer sandboxed — fixing `git push` over SSH being blocked by the HTTP/HTTPS proxy the sandbox injects.
- Inbox `expert` and `request` routines now pass the input file's path to the expert rather than reading and inlining its content, preventing binary inputs from being corrupted by UTF-8 decoding. Failed jobs are parked as dead-letters whose dedup key blocks re-dispatch until the operator triages; succeeded jobs drain their input automatically.

### 5.5.0 — 2026-06-24 UTC

- Headless daemon installs can now get a login-equivalent environment via two new `daemon.supervisor` options: `login_shell` re-execs the startup shim through `$SHELL -lc` so `.zprofile`/`.zshrc` export `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and a full `PATH`; `env_files` sources named env files for token-only injection. Both default off — existing installs are unchanged.

### 5.4.0 — 2026-06-14 UTC

- New `lazy-routine.offer-protocols` skill and `lazycortex-core add-protocols` CLI verb discover optional protocol references and interactively offer them during routine setup — `lazy-review.install` and `spec.install` both use it, so operators are prompted to attach relevant protocols (e.g. `markdown-style`, `doc-review-protocol`) at install time rather than wiring them manually after the fact.

### 5.3.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- The "run the daemon here?" decision is now correctly **per-checkout**, not per-machine. `daemon.run_here` lives in each working copy's own gitignored local settings, so several checkouts of the same project on one machine each decide independently — the daemon runs only on the checkouts you opted in.
- Supervisor units are named per checkout (`com.lazycortex.runtime.<dir>-<path-hash>`), so two checkouts that share a directory name no longer overwrite each other's launchd / systemd unit. Re-running install migrates a legacy single-name unit when it belongs to the current checkout.
- The two install questions are reworded so they can't be confused: the project-policy gate ("does this project use the daemon at all?") carries no "run / here" wording, while the per-checkout gate ("start the daemon for this checkout now?") owns it.

### 5.2.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- Install and setup are now quiet and idempotent. Two remembered daemon gates — project-level `daemon.enabled` and machine-level `daemon.run_here` — replace the old runtime/supervisor confirmations: asked once, then honoured silently on every re-run. Install scope, supervisor kind, and dev-mode are derived rather than asked; rule and template sync follow a 3-case file-sync policy (write/merge silently, prompt only on a genuine conflict, orphans left in place). `lazy-core.setup` drops its run-the-chain confirmation.
- Expert and agent-tier registration no longer waits on the daemon being enabled — they are dispatch-routing config used by interactive flows too, so an enabled plugin always registers them. Expert-class selection is asked only when the experts list is still empty; on a populated list the install completes silently.

### 5.1.0 — 2026-06-02 UTC

- New `lazycortex-core settings-get` and `lazycortex-core settings-set` subcommands let sibling plugins read and write named sections of `lazy.settings.json` from the shell without importing lazycortex-core Python directly.
- Fixed a daemon restart storm: change-detection now compares only the fields shared between the baseline and the current observation, so lazy-loaded imports no longer trigger spurious self-restarts on every iteration.
- Fixed expert-queue starvation: ready jobs are now processed oldest-first across all expert queues instead of alphabetically, so a slower expert no longer blocks jobs that arrived later.

### 5.0.0 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- New error ledger tracks every daemon and job failure as a structured incident — records job deaths, job errors, routine failures, daemon halts, worktree start/finish failures, and doctor triage outcomes, each with a ULID-keyed entry, cause classifier, and resolution state (including `auto_recovered`, `reverted`, `resolved:gone`).
- New `error-record` and `error-list` CLI subcommands on `lazycortex-core` let operators inspect, filter, and close error incidents from the command line; `error-list --since <cursor>` supports incremental polling.
- New `lazycortex-core resume [<repo>]` CLI subcommand clears a daemon halt directly from the terminal; reason-aware — skips the dirty-tree gate for halt causes where a clean tree is not the prerequisite (e.g. `suspected_loop`, `git_pull_diverged`).
- Fixed: the daemon no longer mutates the tracked settings file as a side effect of reading it — `load_section` is now a pure read, eliminating the self-halt loop where every schema bump dirtied the daemon's own tree (Bug 104).
- Fixed: when an agent process exits cleanly (rc=0) but does not write `response.json`, the pump now recovers the response payload from the stream-json stdout transcript, breaking the retry loop that previously re-dispatched the same job indefinitely (Bug 99).
- Fixed: the daemon's loop-detection now keys on the full commit file-set rather than any individual file — a regenerated index committed alongside distinct node edits no longer triggers a false-positive halt.
- Fixed: state.json writes are now atomic — a `runtime_state.update(repo, mutator)` primitive reloads from disk, applies the mutation, and saves, closing a read-modify-write clobber where `dispatch_git` and the main loop overwrote each other's `git_watch` baselines.
- Fixed: worktree `start()` now raises `WorktreeStartError` on a non-zero `git worktree add` exit (e.g. branch or directory collision) instead of silently registering a broken task; the daemon iteration guard wraps the full iteration so any uncaught exception records a `daemon_error` rather than silently crashing.
- Fixed: resolved-and-gone job incidents are now garbage-collected, `resolved:retried_ok` is emitted for clean-DONE jobs that still carried an open incident, and the `lazycortex-review` routine now exits non-zero on error so the daemon's error-ledger emit fires correctly (previously exited 0, suppressing the event).

### 4.0.0 — 2026-05-23 UTC

- **Breaking:** `dispatch_job` redesigned as an atomic primitive — callers no longer pass agent/protocols/git_author; those are derived from `settings.experts[<name>]` inside core. New CLI subcommands `lazycortex-core dispatch-job` and `lazycortex-core collect-job` replace direct Python API calls across plugins.
- **Breaking:** Pump now processes at most one Claude spawn per invocation. Previously all ready jobs in the queue fired in a single tick; now each job lands on its own tick (default cadence 5 s). In-loop retries are removed; transient failures retry on the next tick. Three settings keys removed: `daemon.default_routine_timeout_sec`, `daemon.expert_pump.claude_spawn_timeout_sec`, `daemon.expert_pump.retry_delays_sec` — migrate any customized values to per-routine `timeout_sec` entries.
- **Breaking:** Unified routine-types schema — every routine type now accepts either `command:` or `expert: / request:`. The `agent:` field on md-scan routines is removed; migrate to `expert:` + `request:`.
- **Breaking:** `lazy-recover.dead-jobs` routine renamed to `lazy-runtime.doctor`; CLI subcommand `recover-dead-jobs` renamed to `doctor-tick`. The replacement is a Claude agent that reasons over failure context (request, error output, git status, attempts counter) and decides per case whether to retry, revert-and-retry, or permanently fail.
- New `expert@<repo>` syntax dispatches routines and CLI jobs to a different registered repo. All five routine types (subprocess, inbox, schedule, git, md-scan) support the syntax. The local side writes a `.remote-jobs/` tracker; `list_jobs` and `doctor-tick` surface stuck trackers in triage context. New `lazycortex-core lookup-expert` CLI subcommand validates expert registration in a target repo before dispatch.
- New `lazy.settings.local.json` personal-overlay layer lets each machine supply absolute repo paths and machine-specific config without touching the tracked `lazy.settings.json`. Install sets it up automatically and migrates any required keys.
- New per-routine `priority` key (integer ascending, default 100) lets fast mechanical routines run before slow Claude pumps each tick. New `ignore_halt` flag (default: `false`) allows recovery routines to run while the daemon is halted or the working tree is dirty.
- New `experts.<name>.model` setting overrides which Claude model the pump spawns for a given expert. Omit to inherit the global default.
- Expert spawns now run under `dontAsk` mode with a per-repo filesystem whitelist (worktree + plugin dirs), preventing experts from ranging outside their designated paths.
- Routines' declared `protocols:` list is now correctly forwarded to command-shape subprocess invocations via environment variable. Previously only expert-shape bundles carried protocols; command-shape subprocesses always received the hardcoded default.
- Daemon reliability fixes: halted state no longer busy-loops at 100% CPU; dirty-tree halts clear automatically when the working tree becomes clean; loop-detect halts the daemon when N consecutive recent commits share a single bot author email (configurable via `daemon.loop_detect_threshold`, default 5, set 0 to disable).
- Job queue fixes: dedup key lookup now treats DONE-without-CONSUMED jobs as active, preventing unbounded queue growth when a consumer was broken. md-scan tick no longer aborts on a broken candidate file — per-file errors accumulate and remaining files are processed. New `consume-job` CLI primitive marks a completed job consumed so dispatchers do not re-dispatch stale results.
- Install now automatically removes the legacy `!.memory/` line from `.gitignore` on existing repos; git-guard hook fires on `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events for lock cleanup on session end; md-scan routines use `os.walk` + `fnmatch` instead of `glob.glob`, avoiding mismatches or failures on Python 3.12+.

### 3.2.0 — 2026-05-16 UTC

- The daemon now halts with a specific reason when remote-sync fails during a tick — diverged history raises `git_pull_diverged`, repeated push refusal raises `git_push_failed` — instead of silently continuing in a broken state. `lazy-runtime.recover` gains a `manual-fix` mode that prints reason-specific repair steps and clears the halt block once resolved.
- Duplicate expert jobs dispatched from symlinked repo paths (e.g. macOS Dropbox surface vs. real path) are eliminated: job IDs are now derived from the resolved canonical path. Stale DEAD-marked job slots are renamed out of the way before a fresh dispatch, preventing new jobs from becoming invisible to the pump.
- The daemon supervisor shim accepts a new `--dev-mode` flag; when set, it discovers plugin sources directly from `claude/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in the host repo and injects them before the plugin cache. `lazy-core.install` Step 13 now prompts once whether to enable dev-mode and persists the choice.
- A `projectPath` mismatch encountered during `lazy-core.install` Step 1 is no longer treated as an abort condition — the installer clarifies that this state is recoverable and continues.
- Default model-tier assignments for `lazycortex-experts` agents are now seeded on install; the `lazy-experts.designer` agent is tiered to the Opus model class to match its heavy-reasoning workload.

### 3.1.1 — 2026-05-13 UTC

- `lazy-core.setup` now runs a settings-migration pass (via `lazy_settings.py migrate`) as its first step before installing any plugin; if migration fails, the setup run halts with `aborted-by-migration-failure` rather than proceeding on a stale settings layout.

### 3.1.0 — 2026-05-13 UTC

- **Breaking — `lazycortex-log` absorbed.** The separate `lazycortex-log` plugin is retired and its surface area now ships inside `lazycortex-core`. Consumers must remove `lazycortex-log` from `enabledPlugins`, then re-run `/lazy-core.install` — the install skill migrates the old `lazycortex-log:` settings.json hook entries, drops the absorbed `lazy-log.commit-recorder` hook + `lazy-log.logging` rule into the right places, and bootstraps `.logs/` and `.memory/` directories. The `lazy-log.{clean,distill,recall,timeline,summary,bullets}` skills/agents and the `lazy-log.logging` rule are now plain `lazycortex-core` members — no namespace change in invocation.
- **Per-expert long-term memory subsystem.** New `memory` block ships four skills: `/lazy-memory.mark-persona` opts an expert into the memory pipeline; `/lazy-memory.write` is the only blessed note writer (atomic write + tag-index regen); `/lazy-memory.reflect` dispatches a `kind=reflect` job that synthesises notes from accumulated run logs; `/lazy-memory.index` rebuilds `.memory/.tags/` from frontmatter as a recovery path. Notes live under `.memory/<expert>/` and stay in git. The new `/lazy-memory.reflect-all` CLI verb fans reflect jobs out across every persona-marked expert.
- **Expert aspects + arguments.** Experts now carry two new config-time blocks: `aspects` (composable behavior fragments — the new `persona` aspect is the seed) and `arguments` (named parameters surfaced into the expert prompt). `/lazy-expert.dispatch-job` writes both into per-job `config.json`; the pump renders them alongside the protocol body when spawning the expert. `/lazy-core.audit` Agent D gains three new phases — D8 (aspects), D9 (arguments), D10 (memory hygiene) — and `/lazy-core.optimize` Phase 5.5 prunes stale expert memory directories.
- **Routine `md-scan` type for frontmatter-driven sweeps.** A new routine kind walks markdown files matching a path glob, parses YAML frontmatter via the bundled `frontmatter_parser` primitive, optionally filters on field values, and dispatches a job per matching file. Wizard support lands in `/lazy-routine.register`.
- **Dead-job detection + dispatch deduplication.** The pump now writes a per-job PID file at pickup; the dead-job detector classifies jobs whose owner process has vanished and moves them through a `dead` state. `dispatch_job` accepts an optional `dedup_key` so re-dispatch of in-flight or recently-completed jobs is a no-op rather than a duplicate. New `cleanup_dead_after` settings knob bounds dead-job retention.
- **Per-job `config.json` decouples routines from the pump.** Routines no longer mutate the pump's globals to pass parameters; each dispatched job carries its own `config.json` containing the protocol path, expert config, aspects, and arguments. `PROTOCOL_PATH` and `JOB_DIR` env vars are gone from expert spawn.
- `experts.settings.json` and the `lazy-core.runtime` block are consolidated into the existing `lazy.settings.json` under top-level `experts`, `daemon`, and `routines` keys. The old paths are migrated automatically by `/lazy-core.install`.
- Daemon now passes `--no-optional-locks` to read-only git operations so concurrent terminal `git` commands no longer block on the daemon's `.git/index.lock` lookups.

### 2.1.1 — 2026-05-09 UTC

- Expert subprocess runs now save their full output to `transcript.jsonl` inside the job directory, giving you a post-hoc audit trail whenever an expert behaves unexpectedly. Transcripts are retained for 7 days (the default `cleanup_completed_after` window).

### 2.1.0 — 2026-05-08 UTC

- The runtime daemon no longer clobbers in-progress operator edits: iterations now skip entirely when the working tree is dirty at the start of the cycle, and the halt-on-unexpected-dirt check fires only on paths that became dirty _during_ a routine — not on pre-existing changes from concurrent terminal work.
- Dev-vault daemon startup accepts repeatable `--plugin-dir <path>` flags, and `reference_resolver` now inherits those paths via the `LAZYCORTEX_PLUGIN_DIRS` environment variable — fixing agent and protocol references (e.g. `lazycortex-review:lazy-review.historian`) that previously failed with "plugin not in cache" when the daemon was launched against a local plugin checkout.

### 2.0.1 — 2026-05-08 UTC

- `lazy-core.install` now probes for Python 3.12 at the start of installation and aborts with a homebrew/pyenv upgrade prompt if the floor is not met; runtime glob calls in `reference_resolver.py` and `runtime_daemon.py` are rewritten with `os.walk` to fix a silent failure on Python 3.12.
- `lazy-expert.list-jobs` and `lazy-core.git-status` no longer write a run log when invoked — both are read-only status queries and the log entries were noise with no diagnostic value.
- Fixed: all `lazy-expert.*` skill probes and help docs were pointing at `.claude/experts/` for the expert queue and settings file; the runtime reads from `.experts/` at the repo root. Skills that dispatch or query expert jobs now resolve the correct path.
- `lazy-core.checkup` drops the author-side tool menu (audit, doctor, optimize, pub.status) and runs only `lazy-core.audit` + `lazy-core.doctor` in Phase 1; `lazy-core.doctor`'s budget finding now correctly identifies always-loaded rules by byte contribution rather than mislabeling them as frontmatter violations.
- `lazy-core.skill-writing.md` shipped rule slimmed by 40% (15.8 KB to 9.5 KB, clears WARN threshold); `lazy-core.git` rule's stage-then-commit discipline tightened — plan all edits before any `git add`, run add/pre-commit/commit back-to-back, prefer `mv` over `git mv` for multi-file refactors.

### 2.0.0 — 2026-05-06 UTC

- **Breaking:** All `lazycortex-core` reference files were renamed with type-alignment suffixes (`-schema`, `-contract`, `-protocol`). Consumers using `lazycortex-review` must re-run `/lazy-review.install` or manually update `experts.settings.json`, changing the doc-review resolver key from `lazycortex-review:doc-review` to `lazycortex-review:lazy-review.doc-review-protocol`.
- The `lazy-core.git` rule now enforces a strict stage-then-commit sequence: plan all edits before any `git add`, then issue `git_add` → `/pub.pre-commit` → `git_commit` as a back-to-back triple with no writes in between.

### 1.3.0 — 2026-05-06 UTC

- **Breaking:** The model-routing hook is now registered as `lazy-core.model-router`; the previous name `lazy-core.agent-model-router` no longer exists. Update any local `settings.local.json` entries that reference the old name.
- New `lazy-core.git-guard` hook prevents two Claude sessions from racing on the git index: the first session to call a git tool acquires an exclusive lock; others wait with jitter, detect dead or stale holders, and break the lock automatically. An always-loaded advisory rule (`lazy-core.git`) keeps the mutex protocol in context.
- New `lazy-core.git-status` skill inspects the guard lock and git state without touching the index; `lazy-core.git-unlock` provides a one-step confirmed manual break when the lock is stuck.
- The runtime dispatcher now supports three routine trigger types — `inbox` (watches a drop folder), `schedule` (cron-style interval), and `git` (fires on `new_commits`, `new_files`, or other git events) — replacing the single polling loop with type-aware dispatch.
- The runtime daemon now halts on an uncommitted working tree (both daemon-wide and per-job), preventing expert runs from dirtying the tree without checkpointing. An expert runtime contract is injected into every job so experts know the halt rules.
- New `lazy-runtime.recover` skill restarts a crashed or stalled daemon without manual process management.
- `lazy-routine.register` wizard is now type-aware: it prompts for routine type and configures the correct trigger fields instead of emitting a generic skeleton.
- Opt-in runtime metrics: token usage is now captured per expert job from `claude -p` output; the metrics module uses stdlib only (no extra dependencies); the log directory has file-count retention.
- New `lazy-core.hook-writing` authoring rule and shell hook template give contributors a structured starting point for `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks, including the no-foreign-staged constraint.
- `lazy-core.skill-writing` and `lazy-core.agent-writing` authoring guides now codify the no-dirty-working-tree constraint. `lazy-core.audit` gained an Agent B check that flags files written in a session without a subsequent commit.
- New `lazy-core.reference-writing` rule and three Markdown templates (protocol, schema, contract) for documenting plugin reference artifacts.
- Help documentation overhauled: 13 per-skill walkthroughs replaced by 6 topic blocks (install-and-audit, guardian, runtime, experts, agent-models, git-coordination) and 4 focused walkthroughs (setup-runtime, setup-routine, setup-expert, make-repo-public), each with flow or sequence diagrams.
- `lazy-core.install` no longer runs runtime daemon setup steps when installing a non-runtime plugin scope, preventing unintended side effects during scoped installs.

### 0.6.4 — 2026-05-03 UTC

- **New expert runtime system.** Four new `lazy-expert.*` skills (`lazy-expert.dispatch-job`, `lazy-expert.collect-job`, `lazy-expert.list-jobs`, `lazy-expert.cancel-job`) let you submit work to background expert agents and retrieve results. Two new `lazy-routine.*` skills (`lazy-routine.register`, `lazy-routine.unregister`) manage the routines the daemon runs on each iteration.
- **Serial runtime daemon ships with the plugin.** A per-repo daemon runs registered routines one at a time, syncs the repo with git at each iteration boundary, and writes structured logs under `.logs/lazy-core/runtime/`. launchd (macOS) and systemd (Linux) supervisor templates are included so the daemon can run as a background service.
- **`lazy-core.install` bootstraps the runtime.** Re-running `lazy-core.install` now creates the daemon shim, offers supervisor setup, and walks the expert-system configuration wizard.
- **`lazy-core.audit` and `lazy-core.doctor` cover the runtime.** `lazy-core.audit` gained expert-runtime and daemon health checks; `lazy-core.doctor` gained targeted fix offers for runtime issues and a corrected root-version check.
- **Breaking: CLI subcommand and supervisor units renamed `loop` → `runtime`.** Invoke the daemon CLI as `lazycortex-core runtime …` (was `loop`). Supervisor unit names updated to `com.lazycortex.runtime.*`. Re-run `lazy-core.install` to land updated units. Skills `lazy-core.routine-register` / `lazy-core.routine-unregister` are now `lazy-routine.register` / `lazy-routine.unregister`. The `lazy-core.loop` settings key auto-migrates to `lazy-core.runtime` on first read — no manual edit needed.
- **Breaking: runtime shim relocated.** The per-repo daemon shim moved from `<repo>/.experts/run.sh` to `<repo>/.claude/bin/lazy.runtime.sh`; the job queue moved from `.claude/experts/.jobs/` to `.experts/.jobs/`. Re-run `lazy-core.install` to land the new paths. Supervisor units now reference the shim directly and survive `/plugin update` without re-rendering.
- **Runtime daemon stabilized.** Fixed 9 bugs found during live testing: pump invocation now passes `-p` and `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`; `unregister_routine()` refuses to remove the protected `lazy-expert.pump` routine; git `pull`/`push` now pass `origin <branch>` explicitly so they work on branches without upstream tracking. Also fixed routine-command and reference-resolver cache resolution, both of which previously skipped the version directory and could silently resolve the wrong binary.
- **`lazy.settings.json` hook no longer writes on every read.** The `load_section` helper now tracks a dirty flag and skips the atomic write when nothing changed, eliminating spurious file writes on every pre-tool-use hook invocation. The config tier value `"inherit"` is renamed to `"default"` in `lazy.settings.json`; a per-section `_version` migration ladder auto-upgrades settings on read for this and future schema changes. Malformed settings now emit a one-line diagnostic instead of failing silently.

### 0.3.0 — 2026-04-30 UTC

- `lazy-core.audit` now warns when help-doc chapters are missing (scenarios without a walkthrough) or stale (source skills updated since the chapter's `last_regen` timestamp).
- `lazy-core.agent-models` ships default tiers for lazycortex-review agents, removing the need for manual configuration after enabling that plugin.

### 0.2.49 — 2026-04-28

- `default-tiers.json` is now the single source of truth for per-agent model tiers. The previous `lazy.settings.recommended.md` rule duplicated each plugin's tier block; it has been rewritten as a schema-only document (group definitions, floor cap, tier-choice heuristic, pointers to the canonical JSON). `/lazy-core.install`, `/lazy-log.install`, and `/lazy-obsidian.install` now read tier seeds from `default-tiers.json` at runtime via the cross-plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/lazycortex/lazycortex-core/...`) and fail fast if the SOT is missing — no more hardcoded tables to drift.
- Tier flips in `default-tiers.json`: `statusline-setup` haiku → inherit (cheap built-in should not be pinned), `lazy-log.distill` haiku → sonnet, `lazy-log.summary` opus → sonnet. New canonical entries: `lazy-log.bullets` = sonnet (release-block drafting), plus explicit tiers for `superpowers:code-reviewer`, `claude-code-guide`, `memory.optimise`, and `plugin.extractor`.
- `claude/lazycortex-core/references/scaffold-registry.md` renamed to `lazy-core.scaffold-registry.md` so the filename matches the dot-namespace convention already used by its siblings (`lazy-core.parallel-scan.md`, `lazy-core.setup-phases.md`) and the existing log directory. The pointer in `lazy-core.scaffold.md` was updated.

### 0.2.47 — 2026-04-28

- `lazy-core.scaffold` reshaped into a cross-plugin **registry**: a single always-loaded fenced YAML block keyed by plugin directory name (`<plugin-dir>: → template-path → [globs]`). Each plugin owns exactly one top-level key and mutates only that key during install; the reserved `_local:` key carries customer-authored entries and is never touched by install skills. Replaces the previous "every plugin needs its own scaffold" pattern. Structural-keys shape was chosen so ownership is data-level (no comment markers, no out-of-band annotations) and so other plugins' keys survive any install/uninstall cycle byte-for-byte.
- `lazy-core.rule-writing § 3` ("No large code blocks") gains an explicit exemption for fenced data blocks (`yaml`, `json`, `toml`) that are the rule's primary payload — the 10-line cap was written for embedded runnable templates and should not block a registry/schema rule from publishing its content. `lazy-core.audit` rule-writing-compliance check 5 now honors the exemption.
- Template paths in the registry are consumer-relative (`.claude/templates/core/...`) — once the rule is copied into the consumer's `.claude/rules/`, plugin-root expansion no longer applies. Plugins copy their templates into `.claude/templates/<group>/` during install and point their registry entries at the local copies; customers can edit those copies freely.
- Each `lazy-core.*-writing` rule's `paths:` now also covers its own template path under `.claude/templates/core/`, so reading a template at create-time auto-loads the matching authoring contract — the chain (always-loaded scaffold → Read template → path-scoped contract loads) closes without taxing every turn.
- `lazy-core.rule-writing § 1.2` rewrites the `paths:` shape clause: the inline-array form `paths: ["a", "b"]` is **silently ignored by the Claude Code loader** (rules don't fire, no error). Block-list (`- "<glob>"` per line) is the only form that loads. Audit detection unchanged; doc text now matches runtime behaviour.
- Plugin rules `lazy-core.skill-writing`, `lazy-core.agent-writing`, `lazy-core.setup-phases`, and `lazy-diagram.authoring` migrated from inline-array `paths:` to canonical block-list — they were silently not loading at runtime before this fix.
- `/lazy-core.install` gains Step 4 ("Sync authoring templates"): copies `<installPath>/templates/core/*` into `<consumerScope>/templates/core/`, per-template New / Unchanged / Drift handling with diff-shown overwrite prompts. Step list grew from 7 to 8; existing steps renumbered.
- New `claude/lazycortex-core/references/scaffold-registry.md` documents the registry contract end-to-end: schema, plain-scalar policy, install-skill responsibilities (upsert own key, never touch `_local` or other plugins' keys), and `lazy-core.audit` validation hooks (single fenced YAML block, parses valid, no orphan plugin keys). Other plugins' install skills read this when they need to register Class A authoring-contract templates.
- Authoring-notes block in core templates (`{rule,skill,agent,command}-template.md`) renamed from "delete before shipping" to "delete before saving" — there is no shipping step; the file is just `Write`-saved.
- Frontmatter on `lazy-core.scaffold` slimmed to one-line `description:` + terse `always_loaded:` (matching `lazy-core.hygiene` / `lazy-guard.security` shape) — every byte counts in always-loaded context.

### 0.2.46 — 2026-04-28

- New `lazy-core.scaffold` always-loaded index points new artifact creations at copy-pasteable templates under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/core/{rule,skill,agent}-template.md`. Closes the create-time gap where path-scoped authoring rules (`lazy-core.{rule,skill,agent}-writing`) only fire on `Read` of an existing matching file — now Claude composing a brand-new rule/skill/agent has a structural pointer to the contract before writing the first line.
- Four new templates under `claude/lazycortex-core/templates/core/`: `rule-template.md` carries canonical block-list `paths:` and the rule-writing clause skeleton; `skill-template.md` carries the Execution-Discipline preamble and phase scaffolding; `agent-template.md` carries the single-response model contract and structured-report block; `command-template.md` carries the multi-phase coordinator shape with an alternative verbatim-output (help-style) shape documented in authoring notes. Each authoring rule (`lazy-core.{rule,skill,agent}-writing`) now opens with a `**Template:**` pointer at the canonical path so the Read-time path also surfaces the link.
- `/lazy-core.audit` rule-writing compliance gains check 9: authoring contracts (`*.writing.md` filenames, or bodies with an "authoring" `## ` heading) WARN when they don't reference a template path under `<plugin>/templates/`. Files matching `**/templates/**/*-template.md` are excluded from all rule-writing checks (skeletons, not rules).
- `/lazy-core.doctor` Phase 4 offers a two-step templated fix for the new WARN: copy the base template to `<plugin>/templates/<group>/<derived-name>-template.md` and prepend a `**Template:**` pointer to the rule body, both shown as a diff before any write.

### 0.2.39 — 2026-04-26

- New `/lazy-core.setup` meta-installer brings the current project up-to-date with every enabled plugin's install + post-install configurator chain in a single run. Discovery is convention-based: any `<namespace>.install` skill in an enabled plugin participates automatically, and any skill that opts in via `lazy_setup_phase:` frontmatter (e.g. `lazy-guard.allow-mcp`, `lazy-core.agent-models`) joins the plan in the right phase (pre-install → per-plugin → post-install) without an edit to the meta-installer. Use after `/plugin update`, on a fresh clone, or after enabling a new plugin. Idempotent. Optional `--dry-run` previews the plan without executing.
- New `lazy-core.setup-phases` rule documents the `lazy_setup_phase:` frontmatter contract — allowed values, ordering, and the anti-pattern for skills already chained from inside another install flow (so they don't double-run).
- `/lazy-core.audit` Agent B gains a fourth skill-writing check: WARNs when a `SKILL.md` declares `lazy_setup_phase:` with a value outside `{pre-install, per-plugin, post-install}`.

### 0.2.38 — 2026-04-26

- New `/lazy-core.checkup` unified read-only health command that orchestrates every audit/doctor skill this repo ships (`lazy-core.audit`, `lazy-core.doctor`, `tool.audit`, `tool.doctor`), merges findings into a per-plugin table, and prompts for which mutating fix-flow to run next (`lazy-core.optimize`, `tool.optimize`, doctor fix loops, or `pub.status`). Gracefully handles consumer-only repos by probing for author-side skills before invoking them.
- **Fix:** `/lazy-core.doctor`'s destructive-command guard now explicitly excludes `mcp__git__git_commit` from the `ask` bucket, preventing future drift. Doctor agents had been extending the `ask` bucket by analogy and misclassifying git-commit; the exclusion is now locked down in code.

### 0.2.34 — 2026-04-24

- `/lazy-core.agent-models` is now batch-mode: three grouped prompts (curated defaults / system + other plugins / project agents) each let you accept-all, review one-by-one, mass-set every entry in the batch to `inherit`, or skip the batch — instead of one prompt per agent. The per-agent picker (now only fired when you explicitly choose "review each individually") offers four choices: suggested tier / `inherit` / next-closest tier / skip — restoring the previously-missing `inherit` option that the prior six-option layout dropped.
- New canonical-tier template at `claude/lazycortex-core/skills/lazy-core.agent-models/default-tiers.json` records the recommended tier per known dispatch string — built-ins (`Explore=haiku`, `Plan=opus`, `general-purpose=inherit`, `statusline-setup=haiku`), LazyCortex agents (`lazy-log.summary=opus`, `lazy-log.distill=haiku`, `lazy-log.recall=sonnet`, `lazy-log.timeline=haiku`, `obsidian.gen-tag-pages=sonnet`), and `superpowers:code-reviewer=opus`. The wizard's first batch is built from this template, so accepting it routes ~10 agents in one prompt.
- New `lazy-core.agent-writing § 8`: when creating a new agent in a repo where `lazy.settings.json` exists, the author MUST register its model tier (consult `default-tiers.json` first, heuristic fallback) — and promote canonical defaults back to the template when the dispatch is one every install should get. `lazy-core.audit` Agent B coverage extended to enforce.

### 0.2.32 — 2026-04-24

- New `/lazy-core.agent-models` standalone wizard for assigning per-agent model tiers (`haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus` / `inherit`) without paying for the full `/lazy-core.optimize` pipeline. `--scope=auto` (default) routes each entry to its structurally-correct file: `_user.*` and `_builtin.*` go global, `_project.*` goes project, plugin-domain groups follow the plugin's install scope. `--scope=project|global` overrides; `--dry-run` previews. A single run can write to both global and project `lazy.settings.json` files. `/lazy-core.optimize` Phase 7 now delegates here.
- `/lazy-core.install` per-rule prompts now surface each rule's `description:` from frontmatter as **Purpose:** so you can decide install / overwrite / delete on a New, Drift, or Orphan rule without remembering what the file does. Drift prompts show the full diff inline with What-changed and Why-you-are-seeing-this framing; orphan prompts explain that the plugin no longer ships the rule. Step 5 (`lazy.settings.json` seed) now prints scope, structure, auto-routing, and precedence context above the permission prompt.
- Stripped narrative padding from the `lazy-guard.security` rule — removed a glob-syntax tutorial and a `claude/**` example that was triggering cosmetic drift on every consumer install of the rule and bloating an always-loaded file.

### 0.2.30 — 2026-04-24

- New `lazy-core.agent-model-router` PreToolUse hook routes every `Agent` dispatch to a configured model (`haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus` / `inherit`) via a shared `.claude/lazy.settings.json`. Agents that ship with `model: inherit` can now be cheap-by-default per project without plugins having to hardcode a tier. Set `LAZY_AGENT_MODEL_FLOOR=haiku|sonnet|opus` for a session-wide cap (wins over caller-supplied `model`). Config uses a grouped schema: `_builtin` (Explore, Plan, general-purpose), `_user` (`~/.claude/agents/*.md`), `_project` (`./.claude/agents/*.md`), and per-vendor domains for installed plugins.
- `/lazy-core.install` now seeds `.claude/lazy.settings.json` with defaults for the three built-in dispatch names (`Explore`→haiku, `Plan`→opus, `general-purpose`→inherit) plus empty `_user` / `_project` slots for `/lazy-core.optimize` to fill.
- `/lazy-core.audit` and `/lazy-core.doctor` gain a **Model routing** section: merged-with-provenance view across project + global scopes, orphan/gap detection, invalid-value reporting, env-var status, and a WARN when no `lazy.settings.json` is found at either scope.
- `/lazy-core.optimize` gains a Phase 7 wizard: enumerates every dispatchable agent (built-ins, user-authored, project-authored, plugin-shipped) and fires one `AskUserQuestion` per missing entry — heuristic-driven default tier, or pick haiku/sonnet/opus/inherit/skip. When the config is missing entirely, the wizard first offers to create it (project / global / skip).
- New `lazy.settings.recommended.md` reference doc with copy-paste entries for well-known third-party agents (superpowers, claude-code-guide, statusline-setup, etc.).
- **Rule reorganization:** the authoring-contract rule was split three ways — `lazy-core.skill-writing` (scoped to `.claude/skills/**` and `.claude/commands/**`), `lazy-core.agent-writing` (`.claude/agents/**`), and `lazy-core.rule-writing` (`.claude/rules/**`). Each scope is loaded only when editing the matching artifact type, so authoring a skill no longer drags the agent-frontmatter contract into context (and vice versa). Re-run `/lazy-core.install` to pick up the new rule files.

### 0.2.28 — 2026-04-24

- (Internal release catch-up; no user-facing changes since 0.2.13 — these autobumps accumulated during development. See `docs/changelog.md` for commit-level detail.)

### 0.2.13 — 2026-04-21

- `/lazy-core.optimize` now ships the Phase 2.5 LLM-readability audit: it scans rules, skills, agents, commands, and references for human-oriented constructs (decision-logic tables, narrative preamble, restated cross-references, decorative markers, long explanatory prose) with per-finding Apply / Skip / Waive prompts. Waivers share `lazy-core.doctor`'s `doctor.waivers/` store under the `llm-readability.*` check_id namespace so suppressions carry across both skills.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` gains a permanent WARN-waiver system so reviewed findings can be suppressed across runs. Waivers live in file-based auto-memory by default (reviewable, version-controlled) with a memory-MCP fallback as opt-in; the MCP server name is discovered from the environment rather than hardcoded. Also demotes two "filename lacks dot separator" checks from FAIL to WARN.
- `/lazy-guard.allow-mcp` now infers scope automatically when existing `mcp__<server>__*` entries already pin the server to one scope (global vs. project), eliminating the redundant "which scope?" prompt in the common case. The prompt still appears for first-time server registration or when entries are split across both scopes.

### 0.2.12 — 2026-04-19

- `/lazy-core.doctor` Phase 2.5 no longer WARNs on plugins with unrecorded versions — neither `installed_plugins.json` entries showing `"unknown"` nor marketplace manifests without a `version` field (e.g. GCS-distributed tarballs). Reinstalling doesn't change the manifest format, so the finding was noise. The comparison is now skipped silently when either side lacks a comparable version, and the Phase 2.6 outdated-plugins set is narrowed to match.
- The standalone `no-hardcoded-dynamic-content` rule was folded into `lazy-core.hygiene` as a new "Dynamic content in agents/skills" section — one less always-loaded rule file for consumers. The old file had no dot-namespace prefix and was orphaned; `/lazy-core.install` will prompt to remove it on the next run.

### 0.2.11 — 2026-04-19

- `/lazy-core.doctor` now tracks an **always-loaded context budget**: the summed byte size of `CLAUDE.md` + every rule file without a `paths:` scope. WARN over 20 KB, FAIL over 40 KB. The finding lists per-file sizes largest-first so you can see what's costing tokens on every turn.
- New WARN in `/lazy-core.doctor` for rule files whose frontmatter has neither a `paths:` folder scope nor an `always_loaded: <one-line reason>` waiver. Every unscoped rule without a waiver burns tokens on every turn for every user — the waiver makes the intent explicit. The plugin-shipped `lazy-core.hygiene` and `lazy-guard.security` rules now carry the waiver.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` detects **MCP permission entries with wildcards** (`*`, `?`, `{…}`) and flags them as silent no-ops. Claude Code matches MCP permissions as exact strings, so `mcp__github__*` never matches — the allow/ask never takes effect and every call falls through to the per-call prompt. Fix points at `/lazy-guard.allow-mcp <server>` which enumerates concrete names.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` now distinguishes **local-tool mode** (this repo authors plugins under `claude/**`) from **release mode** (consumer repos). In release mode, if a plugin is outdated per the marketplace-version check, content-level findings on its owned rule files are suppressed — upgrade the plugin first, then re-run to surface any remaining issues. A per-plugin INFO line reports the suppression count.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` trims several never-firing or low-signal checks (Meta-rule mandatory, missing model field, `.claude` allowed-set whitelist, medium-risk-pinned, project `CLAUDE.md` missing, and a handful of others) so the report stays focused on real hygiene issues. Broken-artifact-reference and hook-imports checks are reformulated to reduce false positives.
- `/lazy-core.optimize` thresholds now match the doctor's summed-budget WARN/FAIL so running both in sequence produces consistent verdicts.
- The plugin-shipped `lazy-core.hygiene` and `lazy-guard.security` rule files were slimmed (Meta-rule sections removed, prose compressed) to fit well under the per-file cap with the waiver line added.

### 0.2.9 — 2026-04-19

- **Breaking:** `/lazy-guard.allow-mcp` now uses a 3-bucket classifier. Safe/reversible tools go into `permissions.allow` (no prompt), truly destructive tools go into `permissions.ask` (always prompt), and medium-risk tools stay out of both lists so Claude Code prompts once per call and you decide each time. Default write target flipped to `settings.local.json` (gitignored) so personal permission choices don't leak to teammates through tracked settings. For globally-defined MCP servers the skill asks whether to register at global or project scope. Phase 6.5 strips leaked `mcp__*` entries from the paired tracked `settings.json`.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` now flags per-tool permissions sitting in tracked `settings.json` as leakage and offers an in-place migration to the paired `settings.local.json`. Its MCP hygiene check switched to the same 3-bucket logic — flags destructive tools mis-pinned in `allow`, flags medium-risk tools pinned into either list, and no longer warns about "missing" tools (since `skip` is a valid choice).
- New Phase 2.5 in `/lazy-core.doctor` verifies installed plugins are at the latest marketplace version. Reads `installed_plugins.json`, refreshes each referenced marketplace with a 5s `git fetch` timeout, and WARNs on outdated or unrecorded installs. Transient refresh failures surface as non-blocking INFO.
- The `lazy-core.hygiene` rule's settings-split policy now applies uniformly at both `~/.claude/` and project `.claude/` scopes: tracked `settings.json` owns only enablement flags (`enabledPlugins`, hooks, env, model, statusLine, marketplace registrations) while gitignored `settings.local.json` owns the entire `permissions` block plus machine-specific paths. The `lazy-guard.settings` PreToolUse hook dropped its obsolete "global `settings.local.json` must stay empty" block and now emits a non-blocking warning when per-tool permissions are added to tracked `settings.json`, nudging the edit toward the paired local file.

### 0.2.5 — 2026-04-19

- **Breaking:** `/lazy-guard.allow-mcp` no longer silently allows every tool of an MCP server. It now classifies each `mcp__<server>__*` tool and splits the entries between `permissions.allow` (read-only — get/list/search/recall/…) and `permissions.ask` (destructive — create/update/delete/write/commit/push/retain/…). Ambiguous tools default to `ask` for safety. Re-running the skill after a previous "allow everything" run will **promote** destructive tools from `allow` to `ask`; the Phase 7 report shows `→ allow`, `→ ask`, and `allow→ask` counts so the promotions are explicit.
- `/lazy-guard.allow-mcp` now also strips redundant `mcp__*` entries from `./.claude/settings.local.json` after writing the same entries to the project-tracked `settings.json`. No more stale duplicates accumulating from one-off click-through approvals.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` gains an MCP permissions completeness scan: for every enabled MCP server, it WARNs when a runtime tool is missing from both `permissions.allow` and `permissions.ask`, and WARNs again when a destructive tool is mis-placed in `allow` instead of `ask`. Both findings point at `/lazy-guard.allow-mcp <server>` for the fix.

### 0.2.3 — 2026-04-19

- `/lazy-core.doctor` now cross-references installed rules in `.claude/rules/` against the source files in each owning plugin. Drift (byte-level mismatch) and orphans (namespaced rules the plugin no longer ships) are flagged as WARN and point you at `/<namespace>.install` for reconciliation. Missing rules are intentionally not flagged — the install skill's per-rule prompt lets you skip them deliberately.
- `/lazy-core.install` now asks per rule on install (accept / skip) instead of silently copying every template, shows a diff on drift, and offers to delete orphaned `lazy-core.*` / `lazy-guard.*` rules left over from older plugin versions.
- The coordinator-pattern reference (`lazy-core.parallel-scan`) no longer loads as a rule — it moved under `references/` and is read on-demand by scan skills at dispatch time, shrinking the always-loaded rule set to `lazy-core.hygiene` + `lazy-guard.security`.

### 0.2.2 — 2026-04-18

- New **B4 Author identity in manifests** check in `/lazy-guard.check-public` flags literal author name/email in tracked package manifests (`plugin.json`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `CITATION.cff`, `README*.md`) and auto-waives matches equal to a new `public_author` block in `.guard-waivers.json`. Setting `public_author` records the approved public identity for a repo so every scan — and every collaborator — sees the same answer without scattering per-match waivers.
- `/lazy-core.doctor` now reads `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`, checks each installed plugin's declared dependencies against the actual install set, and WARNs when a required sibling plugin isn't installed.
- `/lazy-core.doctor`'s meta-rule WARN is now scoped — it only fires on rules that actually benefit from a `## Meta-rule` section (size > 3 KB, a paired `<namespace>.config.md` agent, or reference-style structure). Pure-constraint rules under those thresholds no longer produce spurious findings.
- Shipped rules (`lazy-core.hygiene`, `lazy-core.parallel-scan`, `lazy-guard.security`) each carry a one-line `## Meta-rule` section for consistency.

### 0.2.1 — 2026-04-18

- `/lazy-core.install` now installs every rule file shipped by the plugin, discovered via glob. Previously only `lazy-core.hygiene` and `lazy-guard.security` were copied, so new rule files added upstream silently never reached the target project.
- Heavy scan skills (`lazy-core.audit`, `lazy-core.doctor`, `lazy-core.optimize`, `lazy-guard.check-public`) now dispatch parallel Explore subagents internally — scans run faster and consume less main-thread context. User-visible output and interaction are unchanged.
- New `lazy-core.parallel-scan` rule documents the coordinator pattern shared by the refactored scan skills.

### 0.2.0 — 2026-04-17

- New `/lazy-core.help` slash command prints the plugin's purpose and a one-line summary of every skill it ships. Output is verbatim — no tool calls, no log write.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-04-17

- Initial release.
- **Context management** — `lazy-core.audit`, `lazy-core.doctor`, `lazy-core.optimize` measure and slim what Claude Code loads at startup.
- **Security** — `lazy-guard.check-public` scans for leaked secrets, PII, and local paths; `lazy-repo.mark-public` walks a repo through the full public-release flow; a pre-commit hook blocks new leaks.
- **Permissions** — `lazy-guard.allow-mcp` allows every tool of an MCP server in one step, routed to the settings file at the matching scope.
- **Settings protection** — `lazy-guard.settings` hook blocks dangerous edits to `settings.json` / `settings.local.json`.
- **Install** — `lazy-core.install` drops the hygiene and security rule templates into the target project.

## lazycortex-log

### 0.4.0 — 2026-05-08 UTC

- Skills, agents, and commands can now opt out of run logging by declaring `logging-waiver: "<reason>"` in their frontmatter. Empty or boolean values (`true`, `yes`) are rejected; ephemeral subagents dispatched by a coordinator are exempt by class without per-file declarations.
- `lazy-log.audit` now FAILs on malformed `logging-waiver` values and surfaces a "Waiver candidates" section in its report — listing artifacts that should declare a waiver (or have a suspicious one) so you can apply or fix them interactively.
- `lazy-log.install` gains a Step 7 waiver-candidate scan that walks through every installed skill, agent, and command and prompts you to add `logging-waiver:` to any that qualify; pass `--no-scan` to skip.
- `lazy-log.clean` now classifies log folders whose artifact has since been waivered into a dedicated `waivered` bucket and prompts per-folder with the waiver reason, offering delete / distill-then-delete / leave / delete-all-waivered options before moving on to other orphans.

### 0.3.12 — 2026-05-06 UTC

- The `/lazy-log.help` command now surfaces a complete help tree: six topic chapters (install & audit, change history, changelog, housekeeping, troubleshooting, FAQ) plus a `cut-a-release` walkthrough.

### 0.3.5 — 2026-04-28

- New `lazy-log.bullets` agent — converts one plugin's commit range into a user-facing release block (filters internal/refactor/chore commits, rewrites the rest as outcome-led bullets grouped by scope). Dispatched at sonnet tier from `pub.publish` Step 1 so the heavy rewriting doesn't consume opus tokens in the parent session.
- **Fix:** `lazy-log.distill` Stop-hook gate is now per-session — it scans the current session's own transcript for a `git commit` tool call before invoking the distill agent, instead of comparing `.logs/commits.jsonl` mtime (which was shared across all concurrent sessions in the repo and could fire false-positive nudges, including from a Dropbox-sync mtime bump). The standalone `lazy-log.distill-trigger` hook is gone; the replacement lives inside the plugin's `Stop` hook config. The `.logs/.distill-trigger-last-mtime` marker is also gone — no shared state remains.
- **Fix:** `lazy-log.distill` agent's `tools:` allowlist now includes `TaskCreate`. Previously the agent fell back to writing its 7-step checklist into `/tmp/tasks.txt` via Bash heredoc, popping a permission prompt on every distill run.
- The distilled prose changelog moved from `docs/changelog.md` → `.logs/changelog.md`, joining the raw commit log and run logs as a per-contributor local artifact under `.logs/`. `lazy-log.install` migrates the existing `docs/changelog.md` to the new path automatically on next run.
- Per-agent model-tier defaults moved out of `lazy-log.install` into the central `default-tiers.json` shipped by `lazycortex-core` (read at install time from the cross-plugin cache, fail-fast if missing). Tier flips: `lazy-log.distill` haiku → sonnet, `lazy-log.summary` opus → sonnet; new `lazy-log.bullets` entry added at sonnet.

### 0.3.1 — 2026-04-26

- New `/lazy-log.clean` skill — interactive housekeeping for `./.logs/claude/`. It classifies every subdirectory against the live set of canonical skills, agents, and commands; surfaces orphans (renamed skills, anonymous subagent runs); and offers per-orphan choices (merge, distill-to-memory, delete, leave) with anonymous subagent clusters batched by pattern so a folder of 25 `task-N` runs becomes one prompt instead of 25. Read-first — every action waits for explicit approval; nothing is mutated until you confirm. Re-run `/lazy-log.install` after upgrade to register the new skill.
- **Fix:** `lazy-log.distill-trigger` Stop hook now stays silent on first run. When `.logs/.distill-trigger-last-mtime` didn't exist (fresh checkout, first install, or never-distilled repo), the hook's gate trivially passed and it fired regardless of whether commits were actually recorded. Bootstrap now writes the current `commits.jsonl` mtime as the baseline and exits silently; only real future advances trigger the distill nudge.

### 0.2.12 — 2026-04-26

- The `lazy-log.distill-trigger` Stop hook no longer fires on every turn — it now activates only on turns where a commit was actually recorded. Two gates must both pass: `.logs/commits.jsonl` mtime advanced this turn, and pending commits exist beyond the `last-distilled-sha` marker. No-commit turns are silent, killing the per-turn distill noise that hit dev-heavy repos hardest. Commits made outside Claude (terminal, cron) don't trip the hook — invoke the distill agent manually to catch up. The mtime is tracked in `.logs/.distill-trigger-last-mtime` (gitignored under `.logs/`).

### 0.2.11 — 2026-04-24

- (No user-facing changes; version autobumped during a publish-state reconciliation commit. See `docs/changelog.md` for commit-level detail.)

### 0.2.10 — 2026-04-24

- `/lazy-log.install` per-rule prompts now surface each rule's `description:` from frontmatter as **Purpose:** so you can install / overwrite / delete a rule on first sight, without remembering what the file does. Drift prompts show the full diff inline with What-changed framing; orphan prompts explain that the plugin no longer ships the rule. Same UX as the polished `/lazy-core.install`.

### 0.2.9 — 2026-04-24

- New `lazy-log.distill-trigger` Stop hook: at session end, compares `.logs/commits.jsonl` against the `last-distilled-sha` marker in `docs/changelog.md` and, when commits are pending, asks Claude to run `lazycortex-log:lazy-log.distill` before the turn ends. Loop-safe via `stop_hook_active`. You no longer need to remember to run distill manually.
- The `lazy-log.logging` rule's "distill after commits (MANDATORY)" section was rewritten to describe the Stop-hook-driven flow. The hard-skip override ("user says don't distill") still applies.
- `/lazy-log.install` seeds four routing entries into `.claude/lazy.settings.json` under the shared `lazycortex` domain group — `lazy-log.distill` and `lazy-log.timeline` default to `haiku` (mechanical rewriters); `lazy-log.recall` and `lazy-log.summary` default to `sonnet` (ranked retrieval / synthesis). Paired with `lazycortex-core` 0.2.30, this cuts distill cost to a fraction of what it was when subagents inherited Opus from the caller.

### 0.2.7 — 2026-04-22

- `/lazy-log.install` now gitignores `docs/changelog.md` in addition to `.logs/`. The distilled changelog is a per-contributor local cache feeding Claude's change-history recall — tracking it in git would cause merge conflicts between teammates, since every distill run rewrites the same file with a single `last-distilled-sha` marker. Existing installs: re-run `/lazy-log.install` to have the skill add `docs/changelog.md` to `.gitignore`. The file stays on disk; only git-tracking changes.

### 0.2.5 — 2026-04-19

- **Breaking:** the `lazy-log.logging` rule now **mandates** running `/lazy-log.distill` after any non-trivial commit. Previously this was worded as "consider" / "guidance, not a hard rule", and in practice distill was skipped and `docs/changelog.md` stayed empty. Trivial commits (typos, formatting, dep bumps) and explicit per-turn user opt-outs still skip.
- The `lazy-log.logging` rule now carries an `always_loaded: <reason>` frontmatter waiver — a new `/lazy-core.doctor` check (see `lazycortex-core` 0.2.11) requires every unscoped rule to justify being in context every turn. No behavior change for existing installs beyond the waiver line.

### 0.2.3 — 2026-04-19

- `/lazy-log.install` now asks per rule on install (accept / skip), shows a diff on drift, and offers to delete orphaned `lazy-log.*` rules from older plugin versions. Matches the new `/lazy-core.install` flow.
- `lazy-log.audit` now reads `lazy-core.parallel-scan` from `lazycortex-core`'s on-demand `references/` directory, matching the core plugin's rule-slimming pass.

### 0.2.2 — 2026-04-18

- `lazycortex-log` now declares `lazycortex-core` as a dependency in `plugin.json`. Users installing only this plugin will see `/lazy-core.doctor` WARN pointing them to install the required sibling.
- The `lazy-log.audit` skill's cross-plugin reference to `lazycortex-core`'s `lazy-core.parallel-scan` rule now explicitly names the owning plugin.

### 0.2.1 — 2026-04-18

- `/lazy-log.install` now installs every rule file shipped by the plugin, discovered via glob. Future-proof for additional rules.
- `lazy-log.audit` now dispatches parallel Explore subagents internally — runs faster and consumes less main-thread context. User-visible output and interaction are unchanged.

### 0.2.0 — 2026-04-17

- New `/lazy-log.help` slash command prints the plugin's purpose and a one-line summary of every skill and agent it ships. Output is verbatim — no tool calls, no log write.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-04-17

- Initial release.
- Per-commit run logging: every skill, agent, and command writes `./.logs/claude/<name>/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md` with the current `git_sha`.
- `lazy-log.distill` agent turns raw commits into a readable `docs/changelog.md`.
- `lazy-log.recall`, `lazy-log.timeline`, and `lazy-log.summary` agents search across run logs, changelog, git history, and memory.
- `lazy-log.install` bootstraps the logging rule, `docs/changelog.md`, and the commit-capture hook into a project.
- `lazy-log.audit` verifies the logging rule is installed and coherent.

## lazycortex-specs

### 3.0.2 — 2026-07-08 UTC

- The install skill now derives its target scope from where the plugin is actually enabled (via `lazycortex-core detect-scope`) instead of the install record's `scope` field, so its config lands at the correct project-vs-user scope even when the two have drifted.

### 3.0.1 — 2026-06-28 UTC

- Spec designs now describe intended behavior, not current code state — `spec.create-asset` and the feature/change design templates forbid writing existing gaps or unimplemented branches in as limitations unless an explicit operator decision narrows scope.

### 3.0.0 — 2026-06-23 UTC

- **Breaking:** Product-level `design.md` and `tech.md` now live directly at the product root instead of under a `docs/` subfolder. Existing vaults must move `<product>/docs/design.md` and `<product>/docs/tech.md` up one level and delete the empty `docs/` directory. `spec.doctor` flags stray `docs/` folders and the now-reserved product slugs `design` and `tech`.
- **Breaking:** Asset notes now have a structured three-section body — `# Summary`, `# Gates`, `# History` — owned and protected by the plugin (no more `# <slug> — status` title or H2 `Gates`/`History`). `spec.doctor` validates this shape and reports notes still using the old form; existing vaults re-author note bodies into the new shape.
- **Breaking:** New `spec.vault_root` setting (default `specs`) keeps your spec tree in a subfolder separate from the repo root. Subsystem folders and the shared `requests/` inbox are created under `<vault_root>/`, the inbox is always tracked even when empty, and path resolution strips the vault-root prefix when callers pass repo-root-relative paths. Existing vaults move their subsystem folders and `requests/` under the chosen root.
- Category and product-root folder-notes now carry a `# Summary` with an LLM-written précis and a live asset-count statistics line that refreshes automatically after every child-mutating skill (`spec.create-asset`, `spec.set-stage`, `spec.flip-gate`, …). A new `render-container-stats` CLI subcommand refreshes a container note on demand.
- `spec.refresh-sources` regenerates the `# Summary` précis (and container stats) alongside the existing source-attribution re-projection.

### 2.1.1 — 2026-06-15 UTC

- `/spec.install` now seeds review-class writers in the correct schema shape — single-object `history` / `terminal.routing` writers carrying `section` + `position`, with the deprecated `repo` field dropped — and references the `review.historian` expert. Fixes new spec installs producing review classes the audit rejected.

### 2.1.0 — 2026-06-14 UTC

- During `spec.install`, a new sub-step offers relevant routine protocols for the spec routines and merges the operator's chosen ones into the routine config automatically.
- Fixed `spec.product-config` incorrectly scaffolding a per-product `requests/` folder — the request inbox is vault-wide (`<vault-root>/requests/`) and is now set up there; `spec.doctor` and the layout / config / sources protocols were updated to match.

### 2.0.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- **Spec-conformance rebuild (breaking).** Gates are now flat, products live in `lazy.settings.json`, and assets are organized by category with per-category template folders. Re-run `/spec.install` after updating.
- Request handling split into two writers — a routing writer that owns the `# Routing` section and a consumer-supplied interpreter that handles content questions — with every operator tick-list always marking at least one recommended option (`★`).
- The request apply transition is now a deterministic Python primitive instead of an LLM agent: it parses a structured `<!-- routing-decision -->` block, scaffolds spawned assets via the new `scaffold-asset` CLI, distributes the request body, maintains `# Sources` projections, and opens a review cycle on every populated document — in one atomic commit.
- New `# Sources` model: `spec_source_docs` and `spec_source_requests` frontmatter render into `## Docs` / `## Requests` projections with shape-aware default displays; new `/spec.refresh-sources` primitive re-projects them.
- `request_status` collapsed to `{draft, accepted, rejected}`; adapted to the lazy-review v4 review contract throughout.
- Gate cascade hardened — `/spec.gate-tick` promotes `spec_stage` draft→approved and `/spec.flip-gate` auto-promotes an empty `plan.md` to draft, each landing as a single atomic commit.
- `/spec.install` adopts the quiet-install model: scope derived, drift resolved by the file-sync policy, daemon-gated routines, read-first questions only for genuine project config.

### 0.1.7 — 2026-04-26

- (No user-facing changes; internal autobumps from cross-cutting commits — versioning callout sync and a logging-rule description sync. See `docs/changelog.md` for commit-level detail.)

### 0.1.5 — 2026-04-24

- (No user-facing changes; internal plumbing — execution-discipline waiver added to the `lazy-specs.help` command and plugin-dev folder-note gitignore cleanup.)

### 0.1.4 — 2026-04-19

- Internal plumbing — seeded `.claude-plugin/overview.md` so the plugin meets the minimum marketplace surface required by `tool.doctor`. Still a namespace placeholder with no shipped skills; downstream plugins and the marketplace can now depend on the namespace ahead of the first real skill landing. No functional changes.

### 0.1.2 — 2026-04-19

- Internal plumbing — removed an empty `settings.json` stub. No functional changes.

### 0.1.1 — 2026-04-18

- Internal manifest metadata update; no functional changes.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-04-17

- Initial release.

## lazycortex-obsidian

### 2.2.1 — 2026-07-08 UTC

- The install skill now derives its target scope from where the plugin is actually enabled (via `lazycortex-core detect-scope`) instead of the install record's `scope` field, so its config lands at the correct project-vs-user scope even when the two have drifted.

### 2.2.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- The vault installers (`lazy-obsidian.install`, `iconize-install`, `diagram-install`) drop their per-file create / overwrite wizards for the 3-case file-sync policy (write/merge silently, prompt only on a real conflict, orphans kept) and run the full hard-dependency plugin and chained-installer setup without per-step opt-ins.

### 2.1.1 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- `lazy-obsidian.install` no longer aborts when `installed_plugins.json` has a `projectPath` mismatch — only a missing or empty entry array stops the install. The skill also now resolves `lazycortex-core`'s `default-tiers.json` via `$LAZYCORTEX_PLUGIN_DIRS` before falling back to the plugin cache, matching the install convention used by all other `lazy-*.install` skills.
- Fixed latent crashes in `iconize_sync`: a `bytes + str` concatenation on the callback-timeout path now decodes correctly, a `Path|None` value is properly guarded before reuse, and a non-dict icon registry no longer causes an unhandled error.

### 2.1.0 — 2026-05-09 UTC

- `iconize-reloader` 2.4.0: when Notebook Navigator is installed alongside Iconize, the reloader now automatically aligns Notebook Navigator's frontmatter settings (`useFrontmatterMetadata`, `frontmatterIconField`, `frontmatterColorField`) to match the Iconize configuration on load — no more manual alignment of the two plugins. Re-run `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` to deploy the updated reloader.

### 2.0.0 — 2026-05-08 UTC

- **Breaking:** The tag-pages agent has been renamed from `obsidian.gen-tag-pages` to `lazy-obsidian.gen-tag-pages` to match the plugin's namespace convention. Update any dispatch strings, `lazy.settings.json` entries, or code references that use the old name `lazycortex-obsidian:obsidian.gen-tag-pages` to `lazycortex-obsidian:lazy-obsidian.gen-tag-pages`.

### 1.1.5 — 2026-05-06 UTC

- Fixed a bug in the frontmatter rewriter that dropped the blank line after the closing `---` fence, which could produce malformed note output when rewriting Obsidian frontmatter.

### 0.3.0 — 2026-04-26

- **Fix:** the bundled `iconize-reloader` companion plugin now survives Folder Notes' class-strip race condition. When a folder and its folder-note were created simultaneously, Folder Notes' CSS-class management would strip the icon classes that iconize-reloader had just applied, leaving the note rendering as a sibling until you restarted Obsidian. v2.0.8 polls for elements with a 6-second timeout and attaches MutationObservers that revert any class strips instantly. Re-run `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` (or `/lazy-obsidian.update-plugin iconize-reloader`) to pick up the new bundle.
- **Fix:** `/lazy-obsidian.update-plugin` no longer silently resets your Iconize plugin toggles on every update. The shipped `obsidian-icon-folder` settings override was inherited wholesale from an older `data.json` snapshot and re-asserted every Iconize default each run — including `iconsInLinksEnabled: true`, which would clobber any user-set value. The override is now pruned to the three keys iconize-sync actually requires (`iconInFrontmatterEnabled`, `iconInFrontmatterFieldName`, `iconColorInFrontmatterFieldName`); all other user choices survive updates. Re-run `/lazy-obsidian.install` to pick up the slimmer override.
- Removed two `lazy-obsidian.audit` Phase 2 WARNs that scanned the icon-map template for matcher coverage. The template ships with empty matchers by design — consumers author their own in their vault's local `icon-map.json` — so those WARNs always fired on a clean release with no fix path. Matcher-coverage auditing now belongs only to a consumer-side audit of the actual vault's icon-map.

### 0.2.53 — 2026-04-24

- (No user-facing changes; version autobumped during a publish-state reconciliation commit. See `docs/changelog.md` for commit-level detail.)

### 0.2.52 — 2026-04-24

- `/lazy-obsidian.install` Dataview-install prompt and `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` protocol-doc prompts now include pre-write context — what the artifact is, why it's being installed, and what you're approving — so per-file decisions during a fresh vault bootstrap have the surrounding rationale instead of just a path.

### 0.2.51 — 2026-04-24

- `/lazy-obsidian.install` seeds `obsidian.gen-tag-pages=sonnet` into `.claude/lazy.settings.json` under the shared `lazycortex` domain group — the tag-page generator blends mechanical indexing with curated summaries, so sonnet is the appropriate default tier.
- **Fix:** `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` now enforces structural checklist discipline and installs all three hard-dependency plugins (`obsidian-icon-folder`, `folder-notes`, `iconize-reloader`) up front in a single pass. Previously the dependency installs could be silently skipped mid-run, leaving an inconsistent iconize setup that failed to sync icons on save.

### 0.2.49 — 2026-04-24

- (No user-facing changes; version autobumped during an internal plugin README re-sync.)

### 0.2.48 — 2026-04-24

- **Breaking:** `/lazy-obsidian.config` is removed. Vault-plugin install/update behaviour is now factored into a reusable primitive `/lazy-obsidian.update-plugin <id>` and invoked from two entry points: `/lazy-obsidian.install` (installs Dataview for tag-page rendering; offers to chain into `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install`) and `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` (installs the three iconize-sync hard-dependency plugins itself — `obsidian-icon-folder`, `folder-notes`, and the bundled `iconize-reloader`). `/lazy-obsidian.install` is now the root entry point for the plugin family: a single run bootstraps rules, the tag-page template, Dataview, and optionally the iconize-sync system. The deleted skill's opinionated override merges survive unchanged in `templates/obsidian/plugin-settings.json` — `update-plugin` is the new applier. Templates only referenced by the old config skill (`.lazy-obsidian.manifest.json`, `templates/obsidian/community-plugins.json`) were removed. If you relied on running `/lazy-obsidian.config` directly, switch to `/lazy-obsidian.install` or invoke `/lazy-obsidian.update-plugin <id>` for a single plugin.

### 0.2.7 — 2026-04-22

- (No user-facing changes; version autobumped during an internal plugin README re-sync.)

### 0.2.6 — 2026-04-22

- **Fix:** the bundled `iconize-reloader` companion plugin no longer toggles Iconize on every `data.json` change. The previous toggle behavior raced with Iconize's `onunload` writeback — whenever the icon-map worker wrote fresh entries, the reloader fired, Iconize unloaded, and its stale in-memory state clobbered the fresh write (in Dropbox-synced vaults this also produced `(conflicted copy)` files). It also defeated manual disables: turning Iconize off in Settings sprang it back on within ~250ms. The new reloader refreshes Iconize in place via its `loadData()` + `handleChangeLayout()` API and strips stale icon DOM nodes so folders re-paint correctly. If you manually disable Iconize, it now stays disabled.

### 0.2.5 — 2026-04-22

- **Breaking:** `folderNoteName` in the `folder-notes` plugin override (`templates/obsidian/plugin-settings.json`) changed from `"_folder"` to `"{{folder_name}}"`, matching the existing `newFolderNoteName` / `oldFolderNoteName` templates. After the next `/lazy-obsidian.config` run, the `folder-notes` plugin recognizes `<FolderName>.md` inside each folder as the folder note instead of `_folder.md`. If you have existing `_folder.md` files, rename them to the folder's own name to restore folder-note behavior.

### 0.2.4 — 2026-04-22

- New **Stop-hook safety net** closes a gap in the PostToolUse `Write|Edit` hook: edits that land through `Bash`, shell scripts, bulk renames, or `rg | xargs sed` no longer leave Iconize's `data.json` drifting from your icon-map. At the end of every agent turn, a new `iconize_sync.py reconcile-dirty` subcommand scans `git status` for dirty Markdown files and reconciles each dirty prefix in one batched write. Silent no-op on clean trees, non-git vaults, or when the icon-map isn't installed.
- **Fix (regression in 0.2.0):** the plugin-shipped PostToolUse hook wasn't actually writing icons on agent-initiated edits. Claude Code always supplies an absolute `file_path`, but the worker rejected anything starting with `/` — and the hook swallowed stderr, so the failure was invisible. The worker now relativizes absolute paths against the vault root and silently no-ops for paths outside the vault; the hook stopped discarding stderr so future worker errors surface.
- **Breaking:** `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-configure` is renamed to `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-config`. Update any references in your notes or shell history.
- `/lazy-obsidian.config` is now plugin-scope only — it no longer manages top-level Obsidian settings, `.gitignore`, the vault nickname, or MCP wiring. `vault-nickname`, `obsidian-git`, and `obsidian-linter` were dropped from the musthave list. If you relied on any of these phases, manage them separately.
- Community-plugin binaries are no longer vendored with the plugin. `/lazy-obsidian.config` now fetches the latest `manifest.json` / `main.js` / `styles.css` from each plugin's GitHub release at runtime, and only when the installed version is older than the remote. Plugin updates are always fresh; first-run installs don't download binaries they won't use.
- New opinionated per-plugin override blocks in `templates/obsidian/plugin-settings.json` are deep-merged onto each vault's `<plugin-id>/data.json` after every binary sync via `jq`. Any user keys outside the override block are preserved.
- Companion `iconize-reloader` Obsidian plugin (bundled) watches `obsidian-icon-folder/data.json` and soft-reloads Iconize when the worker writes to it, so new icons appear without restarting Obsidian or toggling the plugin.

### 0.2.0 — 2026-04-21

- **Breaking:** the iconize-sync PostToolUse hook is now shipped by the plugin itself (auto-loaded from `hooks/hooks.json`) instead of being written into your `.claude/settings.json` with a hardcoded plugin path. Consumers upgrading from 0.1.23 or earlier **must re-run `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` once** — the install wizard detects and offers to delete the stale PostToolUse entry and migrate the icon-map to the new schema.
- The `.githooks/pre-commit` shim now resolves the worker's plugin path at runtime instead of baking in an absolute `/Users/.../plugins/cache/.../<version>/bin/` path. The shim survives plugin upgrades and machine-to-machine moves, and no longer leaks a local user path into your tracked git hooks.
- New bilateral version handshake between the worker's `SCHEMA_VERSION` / `HOOK_VERSION` constants and the vault's `icon-map.json` — on incompatible drift the hook self-disables silently (exit 0 + stderr diagnostic) so git commits and editor writes never block. `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-sync check-versions` reports the handshake state.
- `/lazy-obsidian.audit` (Phase 1) now cross-checks the schema-handshake constants instead of the deleted PostToolUse snippet template.

### 0.1.23 — 2026-04-21

- `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` now scaffolds the protocol doc at the correct path `.claude/protocol/obsidian.iconize.md`. Previously a typo in the skill's artifact table and orphan-detection note misspelled the filename as `obsidian.iconizeize.md`, so the install would have dropped the protocol at the wrong path.

### 0.1.22 — 2026-04-21

- **Breaking:** Removed `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-file`. Its set/clear/get/list/bulk-apply/reconcile surface over the Iconize plugin's `data.json` is now covered by the new iconize-sync system described below.
- New **iconize-sync** workflow for declarative, frontmatter-driven Obsidian icon assignment, backed by a standalone worker at `bin/iconize_sync.py` and three user-facing skills:
  - `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-install` — per-file scaffolding wizard that drops the protocol doc, local icon-map, pre-commit shim, and PostToolUse hook entry into the vault's git repo. Asks before creating, shows diffs on drift, offers orphan deletion; idempotent.
  - `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-configure` — interactive wizard for adding, editing, or removing registry entries (roles, steps, requests, or any custom registry) in the vault's local `.claude/obsidian-iconize/icon-map.json`. Validates `iconName` / `iconColor` through the worker at prompt time so invalid entries never land.
  - `/lazy-obsidian.iconize-sync` — wraps the worker with five subcommands: `sync <path>`, `sync-staged` (pre-commit), `reconcile [--prefix]`, `install-hooks`, `check-versions`. Concurrent-safe writes into `obsidian-icon-folder/data.json` via mtime-guarded compare-and-swap; preserves `settings`, `rules`, and `recentlyUsedIcons`. Callable standalone, from `.githooks/pre-commit`, or from Claude Code's PostToolUse hook.
- New `obsidian.gen-tag-pages` agent that regenerates Obsidian tag pages from `tags:` frontmatter across every `.md` file in the vault. Six-phase flow (collect → compute parent tags → inventory → diff → delete stale → create new → report). Reads its page template from the consumer repo at `.claude/templates/obsidian.tag-page-template.md` (scaffolded by `/lazy-obsidian.install`), substituting `{{TAG_PATH}}` and `{{SUMMARY}}`. Never overwrites existing tag pages; cleans up empty directories after stale deletions.
- New `/lazy-obsidian.audit` semantic self-check (delegated from `lazy-core.doctor` Phase 3). Verifies iconize-sync coherence: worker `PROTOCOL_VERSION` / `HOOK_VERSION` constants match the `HOOK_VERSION:` markers in the pre-commit shim and post-tool-use snippet; the icon-map template parses and covers at least one authored-doc + one status-file matcher; the protocol template's `owner_skill` points at an existing skill. Read-first; presents findings, then asks which to fix.

### 0.1.2 — 2026-04-19

- Internal cleanup only: dropped two stale doc references to a legacy dotfiles agent in `/lazy-obsidian.config`. No functional changes.

### 0.1.1 — 2026-04-19

- Initial public release.
- **`/lazy-obsidian.config`** — 10-phase greenfield/audit flow that aligns a project's `.obsidian/` with a curated snapshot. Detects greenfield vs existing; syncs musthave and optional plugins with per-plugin diff prompts (overwrite / keep-local / merge-missing-keys); regenerates `community-plugins.json` in dependency-aware load order; drops in the canonical Obsidian `.gitignore` block; prompts for a vault nickname; optionally wires `obsidian-mcp` into project `.mcp.json` with `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="."` so it travels cleanly across machines.
- **`/lazy-obsidian.iconize-file`** — mechanics-only Python primitive for the Iconize plugin's `data.json` (`obsidian-icon-folder`). Supports `set` / `clear` / `get` / `list` / bulk-apply / `reconcile`. Concurrent-safe via mtime guard + retry. Callable standalone or as a primitive from other skills.
- **`/lazy-obsidian.install`** — per-rule-ask + orphan-delete install flow consistent with `lazy-core.install` / `lazy-log.install`. Currently ships no rules; primary job is cleaning up orphans from earlier plugin versions.
- **`/lazy-obsidian.help`** — one-line summary of every skill the plugin ships.
- Depends on `lazycortex-core`.

## lazycortex-diagram

### 1.1.3 — 2026-07-08 UTC

- The install skill now derives its target scope from where the plugin is actually enabled (via `lazycortex-core detect-scope`) instead of the install record's `scope` field, so its config lands at the correct project-vs-user scope even when the two have drifted.

### 1.1.2 — 2026-06-14 UTC

- Added the `lazy-diagram.authoring` and `lazy-diagram.writer-guide` reference material the per-format drawer agents read while composing a diagram. No change to how diagrams are requested or generated — the guidance sharpens the agents' output.

### 1.1.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- `lazy-diagram.install` adopts the 3-case file-sync policy — install scope is derived from `installed_plugins.json`, rule drift is merged silently with a prompt only on a genuine conflict, and no-longer-shipped rules are kept in place. The per-rule install / overwrite / delete prompts are gone.

### 1.0.12 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- _no user-visible changes_

### 1.0.11 — 2026-05-08 UTC

- _no user-visible changes_

### 1.0.10 — 2026-05-06 UTC

- New `lazy-diagram.help` command provides built-in documentation covering drawing workflows, installation, troubleshooting, and FAQ.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-04-27

- Initial scaffold. Format-agnostic diagram engine: planner skill + per-format writer agents (mermaid, ascii, more later). Picks kind and format from request context, ships exemplar templates plus an authoring contract, and bundles a fixture-based regression suite.

## lazycortex-review

### 5.2.1 — 2026-06-15 UTC

- The plugin's shipped experts are now keyed `review.historian` / `review.doc_doctor` (the `<domain>.<role>` convention). `/lazy-review.install` registers them under those names and pins the `review.doc_doctor` repair resolver so it still resolves.

### 5.2.0 — 2026-06-14 UTC

- `lazy-review.install` now discovers optional routine protocols during setup and asks which ones to add — references that declare themselves protocol candidates are presented as an opt-in choice, and the picks are merged into the routine's protocols list automatically.
- Fixed `lazy-review.install` never registering the `lazy-review.historian` and `doc_doctor` experts shipped with the plugin, which caused any review class referencing them to fail.

### 5.1.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- `lazy-review.install` gates the `lazy-review.scan` routine on the project `daemon.enabled` flag and applies the file-sync policy; `lazy-review.configure` keeps its genuine project questions (class globs, writers, sections, marker style) but reads each from record first, re-prompting only to change a value.
- Diff edit-markup rendering corrected: `+`/`−` markers that span a fence boundary now cancel properly, so a region added and removed within the same change no longer leaves a stray marker behind. Expert dispatch also fixes a class-match nesting bug that could route a document to the wrong review class.

### 5.0.0 — 2026-06-03 UTC

- Complete rewrite of the document-review engine. Ownership isolation is now enforced in code, not in agent prompts: if a section writer strays outside the H1 it owns, the operator's body is restored byte-for-byte, and any agent attempt to write the reserved review-state keys is dropped before it can reach the document.
- The status banner is authoritative and always current. Every change to the top banner is its own mechanical commit and takes priority over all other work, so the operator sees "whose turn it is now" within seconds of any state change. The waiting banner now names the phase it is in (`Waiting: validators` / `Waiting: terminals` / `Waiting: writer`).
- Frontmatter edits are surgical line edits — block-style YAML, inline arrays, comments, and quoting style all survive byte-for-byte; the review machinery never reformats your frontmatter.
- New section model. A review class declares its writers as a map keyed by writer group (`main`, `history`, `final`, and one per review section); each section carries its own H1 title, a stable section id, and a `top` / `bottom` position relative to the operator's free body. Exactly one writer owns each section, identified by a two-part ownership tag, so the same expert can safely own two different sections in one document.
- Post-approve validation and terminal review now run as a barrier instead of a cascade: all validators are dispatched at once and collected in a single pass, so a concern raised by the first validator no longer prevents the others from running in the same round. The historian is invoked exactly once, against the approved state, and finalize waits for any pending historian job.
- Cross-plugin protected sections are preserved through finalize. A region owned by another plugin (for example the wiki's `# See also` block, inner HTML markers and all) survives a finalize pass verbatim instead of being stripped.
- Slash commands (`/lazy-review.start` / `stop` / `finalize` / `status` / `iterate`) are now thin, atomic dispatchers over a single `lazycortex-review` CLI — each leaves a clean working tree on return and writes a per-action JSONL run log. The runtime driver is an `md-scan` routine that scans each review class's configured paths and processes one document at a time.
- A new `/lazy-review.submit` verb opens a review on a document whose changes are already written, skipping the opening writer round.
- The standalone webhook server and the in-plugin polling mode were removed. Remote git work (pull / push / rebase / reset) is now the `lazycortex-core` runtime daemon's responsibility; lazy-review's own git surface is intentionally narrow.
- The two always-on `rules/` files were removed — verb discovery, the dispatch contract, and the consumer cheatsheet are now available on demand (via the session skill list, the doc-review protocol reference, and `/lazy-review.help`) instead of taxing every markdown session's context.
- The `/lazy-review.configure` wizard was rewritten for the new section model, and `/lazy-review.install` now seeds the review scan routine with sensible runtime defaults out of the box.
- Reliability fixes: every queued job's configuration is written before the job is marked ready (no spawn race); every dispatched expert reliably runs under the doc-review protocol; completed jobs are marked consumed so a daemon restart never re-applies a stale answer; and the operator's whole-document approve is recorded durably before the banner repaints, so the finalize chain always fires.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-04-30

- Initial scaffold. Unattended doc-review dispatcher — routes documents to specialist agents (shell or MCP) round-by-round; consumer plugins use the public API (rule + 4 verb skills).

## lazycortex-observe

### 0.2.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- `lazy-observe.install` reuses persisted operator config (agent kind, remote-write URL, auth) instead of re-asking and renders its configs under the file-sync policy. `lazy-observe.uninstall` keeps its destructive confirmations but is now a silent no-op when the targets are already gone.

### 0.1.7 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- Fixed a template-engine bug where `{{ var }}` expressions inside `{% for %}` loop bodies were evaluated before the loop variable was bound, emitting empty strings on every iteration. On macOS the generated launchd plist had empty `<string></string>` arg entries, so the agent started with no CLI arguments; on Linux the systemd unit's `ExecStart` args slot collapsed to whitespace.
- Corrected stale configuration-key paths in the README, overview, troubleshooting page, and ship-metrics walkthrough — references to the removed `lazy-core.runtime.metrics` / `lazy-core.runtime.routines` nesting now point to the correct flat keys (`daemon.metrics`, `routines`).

### 0.1.6 — 2026-05-08 UTC

- New `/lazy-observe.help` command ships a full help layer: three reference chapters (install & audit lifecycle, troubleshooting with a diagnostic flowchart, operator FAQ) and an end-to-end walkthrough for shipping metrics from scratch.

### 0.1.5 — 2026-05-06 UTC

- New `/lazy-observe.help` command surfaces three help chapters (install & audit lifecycle, troubleshooting with a mermaid decision tree, operator FAQ) plus a `ship-metrics-end-to-end` walkthrough covering the full install-to-doctor path.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-05-05

- Initial scaffold. Ship lazycortex-core runtime metrics to a Prometheus-compatible observer (Grafana Alloy or OpenTelemetry Collector) — vendor-neutral, observer-server-blind, headless-portable.

## lazycortex-experts

### 0.5.1 — 2026-07-08 UTC

- The install skill now derives its target scope from where the plugin is actually enabled (via `lazycortex-core detect-scope`) instead of the install record's `scope` field, so its config lands at the correct project-vs-user scope even when the two have drifted.

### 0.5.0 — 2026-07-06 UTC

- New `fiction-writer` expert agent for prose and story craft, with a matching default tier in lazycortex-core.
- New sci-fi and fantasy genre aspects, layering genre-specific voice onto the fiction-writer expert.
- New tech-writing discipline aspect for dry, terminology-consistent technical prose.
- `lazy-experts.install` now auto-derives aspects by class — genre classes seed fiction-writer only, technical classes gain the tech-writing aspect — with a fix excluding cross-cutting aspects from that derivation and verifying agent references during install.

### 0.4.1 — 2026-06-28 UTC

- The designer and interpreter agents no longer trim specs down to match the current state of the code. Existing gaps, partial paths, and TODOs are treated as evidence of work in progress — not as constraints to encode. Only an explicit operator decision can narrow scope.

### 0.4.0 — 2026-06-23 UTC

- Three new execution-stage experts — `implementer` (test-first discipline, Sonnet), `debugger` (root-cause-first four-phase investigation, Opus), and `reviewer` (ranked findings with evidence, Opus) — each ships with a default model tier pre-registered so no manual configuration is needed after install.
- A new cross-cutting discipline aspect is now composed onto every expert, enforcing verify-before-completion, refusing to guess past a knowledge gap, suppressing performative agreement, and converting human-gate moments into open document points rather than silent assumptions.
- The `interpreter`, `designer`, and `planner` experts now enforce tighter behavioral invariants: interpreter surfaces 2–3 candidate directions rather than settling silently, designer treats scope boundary and declarative voice as hard constraints, and planner flags any placeholder as an incomplete task.
- The plugin's help command now lists all six expert agents and the discipline aspect, reflecting the full current surface.
- Fixed stale install copy — the skill description and role-selection prompt now correctly enumerate all six expert roles.

### 0.3.1 — 2026-06-15 UTC

- Composed expert keys now use the `<domain>.<role>` convention (`claude-plugin.designer`, `game.interpreter`, …), consistent with the other plugins' expert keys. Re-run `/lazy-experts.install` to register the dotted names; existing entries are left untouched.

### 0.3.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- `lazy-experts.install` seeds agent-model tiers for the three generic agents (interpreter, designer, planner) and composed expert entries (agent × domain-aspect, each carrying a persona aspect and a deterministic bot author). Registration is no longer gated on the daemon — experts and tiers are dispatch-routing config used by interactive flows too. Expert-class selection is asked only when the experts list is still empty; re-runs are idempotent and never overwrite existing entries.

### 0.2.1 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- The install skill now resolves sibling-plugin artifacts via `$LAZYCORTEX_PLUGIN_DIRS` before falling back to cache-directory discovery, so installation works correctly when the environment variable is set.

### 0.2.0 — 2026-05-16 UTC

- `lazy-experts.install` now seeds nine ready-to-use composed expert configurations (each pairing an agent role with an aspect and persona) into the target project automatically at install time, so no manual expert-entry setup is required after installation.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-05-15 UTC

- Three built-in expert agents ship with the plugin: `lazy-experts.designer` (heavy-reasoning UI/UX and visual work), `lazy-experts.interpreter` (code explanation and analysis), and `lazy-experts.planner` (multi-step planning and decomposition) — ready to invoke without any configuration.
- Three domain aspect files provide pre-built expert context for Claude-plugin development (`lazy-experts.claude-plugin-aspect`), game development (`lazy-experts.game-dev-aspect`), and dotfiles management (`lazy-experts.dotfiles-aspect`), giving the expert agents scoped background knowledge for each domain.
- `lazy-experts.install` skill and `lazy-experts.help` command are included: `install` registers the plugin's agents and aspects into the active project; `help` surfaces available experts and usage patterns.

## lazycortex-python

### 1.9.2 — 2026-07-06 UTC

- Fixed a bug in the re-export dedup logic where inherited test methods (e.g. `TestA(Base).test_x` and `TestB(Base).test_x`) collapsed to one entry and the rest were silently dropped, causing real tests and their coverage to be lost. Dedup now keys on the collected class rather than the function object, so each subclass is tracked separately while shim duplicates still collapse correctly. Parametrized variants remain distinct via the item name suffix.

### 1.9.1 — 2026-07-06 UTC

- `tst-py` now automatically deduplicates test items collected more than once through re-export shims (e.g. a `test_all.py` aggregator alongside per-package shims), so each test runs exactly once; double-collection order-dependent failures are eliminated with no configuration required.

### 1.9.0 — 2026-07-06 UTC

- `chk-py`/`tst-py` now source an optional project-declared env script (`python.env_source`) before running checks/tests, so secrets or provider credentials bootstrapped by a project's own shell wrapper are available instead of leaving tests half-configured. `lazy-python.install` will prompt to configure this automatically.
- The Verification Order style rule now defers to a project's own declared test runner instead of overriding it.

### 1.8.1 — 2026-06-27 UTC

- **`pcf` false-positive fixes:** the critical-fail style checker no longer flags dunder tokens (`__name__`-style) as unresolved identifiers, and now resolves the attribute-name literal of `getattr` / `setattr` / `hasattr` / `delattr` in its main analyzer pass — fewer spurious magic-literal findings on dynamic-attribute code. Drop-in via `/plugin update`.

### 1.8.0 — 2026-06-27 UTC

- **Action required (re-run install):** The `chk-py` and `tst-py` CLI wrappers now resolve the active plugin installation at runtime instead of baking an absolute, version-pinned path at install time. This fixes the wrappers going stale after every plugin update. Existing consumers must re-run `/lazy-python.install` to redeploy the new wrappers; a bare `/plugin update` alone does not propagate the fix.

### 1.7.1 — 2026-06-13 UTC

- Documentation fix: the `/lazy-python.install` walkthrough now matches the actual install — seven steps that ask nothing (PyCharm `pch` is auto-detected, `CLAUDE.md` is never touched). The previous text still described the removed prompts. No behaviour change — `/plugin update` is all that's needed.

### 1.7.0 — 2026-06-11 UTC

- `/lazy-python.install` no longer asks about PyCharm offline inspections (`pch`) or a CLAUDE.md pointer. It probes for PyCharm first and adds `[tool.pch]` to `pyproject.toml` automatically when PyCharm is present (omitting it otherwise) — no prompt — and it never touches your `CLAUDE.md` (the plugin rules load from `.claude/rules/` regardless). `/lazy-python.audit` follows suit: `[tool.pch]` and the CLAUDE.md pointer are no longer treated as required, so their absence is informational rather than a warning.

### 1.6.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- `lazy-python.install` resolves drift via the file-sync policy (pyproject and overlay guidelines merge silently, prompt only on a direct contradiction), derives install scope, and persists the `pch` and CLAUDE.md-pointer choices so a 'no' is never re-asked.

### 1.5.0 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- PyCharm inspections (`chk pch`) are now opt-in per project: `chk pch` skips cleanly in repos that have no `[tool.pch]` section in `pyproject.toml`; the installer prompts before adding that section; and `lazy-python.audit` no longer fails repos that omit it.
- `chk` and `tst` invoked from a subdirectory no longer create a stray `.venv` in that subdirectory — the venv is now anchored to the repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` when `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is unset.
- `pcf` D4 (missing `Returns:` docstring section) no longer false-positives on functions annotated `-> NoReturn` or `-> Never`; those annotations signal no return value, so the section would be incorrect and the check was previously unsuppressable.
- New `pcf` check detects silent broad-except: `except Exception`, `BaseException`, or bare `except` whose body is a plain `pass` (no log, no return, no re-raise) is flagged; narrow clauses and non-silent bodies are exempt; add `# waiver: <reason>` above the clause to suppress.

### 1.4.1 — 2026-05-27 UTC

- New plugin: `lazycortex-python` ships style, docstring, and test discipline rules (`lazy-python.style`, `lazy-python.docstrings`, `lazy-python.tests`), five reference guidelines, a canonical `python-template.py` skeleton, and a `pyproject-defaults.toml` template — everything needed to bootstrap a compliant Python project.
- New `lazy-python.check-style` skill, `chk` aggregator (runs `pcf → toi → pch → mypy → ruff → pylint` in one command), and `tst` runner; `ruff` and `cmp` (py_compile) are now included in `chk all`, and `pytest-clarity`/`pytest-sugar` are provisioned in the venv automatically.
- New `lazy-python.install` skill sets up a consumer project in one step: mirrors rules and wrapper scripts, bootstraps `pyproject.toml`, appends a discipline pointer to `CLAUDE.md`, and registers the PostToolUse check-style hook — no manual wiring needed.
- New `lazy-python.audit` skill runs 11 invariant checks against an installed consumer project and reports `PASS`/`WARN`/`FAIL` per check, covering rule presence, scaffold registry, `CLAUDE.md` pointer, hook registration, and venv state.
- New `lazy-python.docstring-writer` and `lazy-python.test-writer` agents automate docstring coverage and test generation for Python modules.
- The check-style hook is now auto-registered via `hooks.json` at install time without requiring `source_roots` configuration; the hook correctly probes both `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` when adding the discipline pointer.
- `chk` and `tst` now work from a bare terminal (no `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_*` environment variables required); the fallback venv is created inside the project's own `.venv/` (augment-not-wipe) and `.venv/` is gitignored automatically on install; the scaffold step now reliably delivers `python-template.py` into the consumer project via `lazy-core.scaffold-sync`.

## lazycortex-wiki

### 1.5.2 — 2026-07-08 UTC

- The install skill now derives its target scope from where the plugin is actually enabled (via `lazycortex-core detect-scope`) instead of the install record's `scope` field, so its config lands at the correct project-vs-user scope even when the two have drifted.

### 1.5.1 — 2026-06-15 UTC

- The curator expert is now keyed `wiki.curator` (was `wiki-curator`) to match the `<domain>.<role>` expert-key convention. Re-run `/lazy-wiki.install` to register the dotted name.

### 1.5.0 — 2026-06-11 UTC

- `/lazy-wiki.install` no longer prompts to create your first wiki scope at the end. When no scopes are configured it just points you at `/wiki.configure` — configuring a scope is operator-driven work, not an install question.

### 1.4.0 — 2026-06-10 UTC

- `lazy-wiki.install` now registers the `wiki-curator` expert unconditionally — it is dispatch-routing config, not daemon-only — and gates only the two curator routines (`wiki.scan`, `wiki.relink-weekly`) on `daemon.enabled`. Rules sync via the file-sync policy; `lazy-wiki.configure` reads persisted scope config first and re-asks only to change it.

### 1.3.0 — 2026-06-03 UTC

- Documents currently under review are automatically excluded from wiki curation, indexing, and linking; they rejoin the wiki when the review is finalized. Configure with a per-scope `filter` predicate via `/wiki.configure` or `/wiki.install`.
- The wiki now emits its See-also block as a `#protected/wiki/see-also` section, establishing a stable cross-plugin contract so that review and other plugins can preserve the region byte-for-byte during their own finalization passes.
- Tag values stay consistent across incremental runs: new `collect-tags` and `retag` subcommands survey and rename axis values scope-wide; a new `normalize-tags` curator kind judges a canonical value set and self-applies it; `/wiki.relink` and the daemon `process-file` path both feed existing tag values as a classify anchor so the curator reuses in-use values instead of coining synonyms.
- Existing nodes that attract a newly classified node now receive incremental link updates immediately via reverse-candidate fan-out, rather than waiting for the next weekly `relink-all` pass.
- Redundant back-link dispatch is skipped when an attractor node already forward-links to the target, saving roughly 60–90 seconds of LLM time per redundant job.
- `relink-all` subcommand is now implemented; previously it was declared but always returned not-implemented, breaking the `wiki.relink-weekly` scheduled routine.
- **Fix:** YAML special characters (colons, apostrophes, boolean literals, etc.) in frontmatter scalar fields such as `wiki_summary` are now correctly single-quoted, preventing parse errors in strict YAML consumers like Obsidian.
- **Fix:** Dispatcher dedup key now includes the job kind and a normalized absolute path, so classify and link jobs for the same node are no longer collapsed into one key — link jobs were silently eaten by a completed classify entry, leaving most relink-all link passes unexecuted.
- **Fix:** `/wiki.install` previously seeded `wiki.scan.watch` as a list, crashing the git-routine validator on every HEAD change; it now seeds the correct string value.

### 1.2.0 — 2026-06-01 UTC

- New `/wiki.query` uses a two-phase subagent retrieval model: a `lazy-wiki.seeker` agent picks entry points from `topics.md`, then `lazy-wiki.gatherer` traverses See-also links and synthesises the answer — keeping large index and node bodies out of the main session context.
- Fixed query path resolution: entry-point paths from the seeker are now rebased to repo-relative before the gatherer resolves them, fixing broken lookups when `topics.md` lives outside the repo root.
- Tag consistency across incremental runs: new `collect-tags` and `retag` subcommands survey axis values in use and apply an alias map to normalise synonyms; `/wiki.relink` and the daemon's per-file path both pass existing tag values as an anchor to classify, so the curator reuses established values instead of coining synonyms.
- New `relink-all` subcommand is now fully implemented — enumerates every scope node and dispatches a classify job for each, enabling a forced full pass when, for example, a new node requires existing nodes to reconsider their links.
- Incremental backlinks on classify: when a node is classified, link jobs are now also dispatched for every scope node that is a reverse candidate for it, so existing nodes gain links to the new node without waiting for the next weekly relink.
- Fixed a dispatcher deduplication bug where classify and link jobs for the same node collapsed to the same key (causing link jobs to be silently dropped), and where relative vs. absolute paths produced different keys for the same node.
- Fixed broken wiki installation: `/wiki.install` was seeding `wiki.scan.watch` as a list instead of a string, crashing the git-routine validator and preventing scan dispatch on every file change.
- Fixed wiki curator commits using the wrong author identity: the agent's commit step now explicitly instructs the curator not to pass `--author`, relying on the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` env vars the pump already sets.
